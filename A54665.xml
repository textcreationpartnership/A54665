            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>Preface</hi> to the READER.</head>
            <p>ANtiquity is the great Luminary of Time, which diſpels thoſe Clouds, that like a gloomy Skreen, interpoſing between the object and the underſtanding, caſt it into Error and Miſapprehenſion: And not onely of Time but of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too; Hiſtory, that faithful Regiſter of things paſt, That great Informer of the preſent, and certain Prophet of the Future; By it we may diſcover the Print which former Ages made, and treading that, know how to decline the crooked and Irregular Paths of Danger and Misfortune. Antiquity is like the lamp in <hi>Tullia</hi>'s Urne, that repreſenting to our view by Grains and by Scruples the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and duſt of our long-ſince expired Anceſtors, which perhaps lay ſcatter'd in the Wilderneſs of their own Diſperſion, erects a Monument to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, ſo inacceſſable to all the onſets and impreſſions of age and oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that then onely it ſhall languiſh into Decay and diſſolution when Nature her ſelf, and Time, the moth of Nature, ſhall lye gaſping in their own ruines, and the Univerſe it ſelf ſhall confeſs its Aſhes.</p>
            <p>And certinly, amongſt all thoſe Trophies which antiquity hath fix'd upon the face of this Iſland, there is none more Copious, if we conſider them for quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; nor more Conſpicuous, if we repreſent them in their quality, than thoſe that it hath left ſcatter'd upon the Continent of <hi>Kent:</hi> and this muſt be obvious to the moſt eaſie Intellect, when it ſhall diſcover that in all the Eruptions of forain Invaders upon this Iſland, the firſt track of that Thorough-fair hath been laid in, or very near, this County, by which they have farther penetrated into the Bowels of this Nation. We will wave that fiction of <hi>Brute</hi> and a partie of Fugitives (originally) as the <hi>Legend</hi> inſinuates of <hi>Trojan</hi> Extraction, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded from <hi>Italy</hi> for ſome Miſdemeanor there acted) fixing here, as likewiſe that Series of the Kings Subſequent to him, being wholy obtruded upon us by ſeduced and miſguided Hiſtories; the brain indeed of <hi>Jeffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> being both the Forge and the Anvill from whence thoſe ſparks brake forth at firſt, which made up that <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> after which the world ſo long hath wandered.</p>
            <p>Firſt then the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles endevoured to ſurprize and ſeiſe on the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this Iſland, though they were once or twice ſo rudely grip'd by the <hi>Britains</hi> neare <hi>Chilham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and ſome of their nobleſt Plumes torn from them, that they were forc'd to fly back into <hi>Gaule</hi> to new impe their Feathers but breaking in again with a recolected and multiplied ſtrength, the Liberty of this Nation ſtoop'd, and became a prey to their victorious Tallons, And now it was ordered that all Pleas, Eſcripts, Decrees, Edicts, and other things of publique Cogniſance ſhould be iſſued out in the <hi>Roman</hi> Dialect, that ſo the roughneſs of the <hi>Britains,</hi> which their warlike inclinations had ſo long entitled them to, might not onely by degrees be fil'd off, but that likewiſe being ſuppled and ſoftned by the <hi>Roman</hi> Culture, they might without any regret or reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:103337:6"/>ſupport that load of ſlavery that ſat ſo heavy on their ſhoulders, and ſo at laſt become wholy riveted and incorporated into the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>But this was onely in intention, for the accompliſhment and perfection of it, was ſuperſeded by the Inroad of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> which like an Inundation in many ſignal conflicts had almoſt ſwept away the Imperial dignitie, and ſo torn the whole Bulk of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that its very Spirit was ready to ebb out at thoſe breaches. So that in fine, the Emperour was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the Guards and Stationary Legions ſcattered o're this Iſland, with theſe like a new ſtock of ſpirits to improve and fortifie the Heart of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which was ready to bleed out its life at thoſe wounds that the hands of theſe Barbarous Nations had inflicted on it.</p>
            <p>And now the ſpirits of the <hi>Britains</hi> (a ſtronger Buttereſs againſt the Eruptions of the <hi>Picts</hi> than the Wall erected by the <hi>Romans</hi>) being by the Engines of a long and habituated Servitude, cowed and broken into a degenerate Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacie, they lay open to all the Aſſaults and impreſſions of the inſolent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader; ſo that they were forced either to reſign up themſelves to the fury and inclemency of the Sea, or elſe offer themſelves up to the Rage and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity of a Savage enemie: And now, being deveſted of all protection at home, and all hope of ſupply from abroad, being forelaid and intercepted by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the <hi>Goths</hi> on the Empire, they made their addreſſes to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> a Martial People then inhabiting that nether part of <hi>Germany,</hi> which is waſhed by the Rivers of <hi>Elve, Weaſer,</hi> and <hi>Rhine,</hi> who inſtantly upon Covenant and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of a vaſt Guerdon to ballance their ſervices, under the conduct of <hi>Hengiſt</hi> and <hi>Horſa,</hi> embarqued for <hi>Britain</hi> and landed in the Iſle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> and ſhortly after with ſuch vigour and animoſity repreſſed the inſolencies of the <hi>Picts,</hi> that they ſhut them up within the Cloiſters and Receſſes of their own Mountains. But it might be ſaid of them, as it was anciently of Religion; <hi>Religion brought forth Riches, and the Daughter devoured the Mother:</hi> So theſe <hi>Saxons,</hi> from Aſſertors and Protectors of the <hi>Britains,</hi> became at laſt Invaders of them; for they repreſenting to the other <hi>Saxons</hi> the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Air, and the temperateneſs of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Clime, who were over-ſtocked and cloyed with exceſs of People, and were willing to evacuate that ſurcharge of Inhabitants into forain Colonies, they inſtantly attaqued any advantage that might put them into Hoſtilitie with the <hi>Britains;</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that that Compact ſo ſolemnely ſtipulated and tranſacted between them and <hi>Hengiſt</hi> was infringed and violated, they poured themſelves in like a <hi>Cataract</hi> upon this Iſland, ſo that the <hi>Britains</hi> to ſecure themſelves from the fury of this Deluge, after many vigorous attempts to make it flow back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſhut up themſelves within the Solitudes and Receſſes of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> whileſt on their ruines their adverſaries erected and fixed their <hi>Saxon Heptarchie;</hi> which again, after many mutual encounters, wherein almoſt every Turfe of this Iſland was beſpatter'd and bedewed with Blood, found a publique Tombe in the <hi>Weſt-Saxon</hi> Monarchie.</p>
            <p>But ſcarce was the Baſis of it eſtabliſhed, whoſe Ciment was ſo much Blood and Tears; But God, who corrects the Ambitious by retaliation and chaſtiſes the inſolencies of one Invader by caſting another into Competion with him, put the <hi>Dane</hi> into Ballance with the <hi>Saxon,</hi> who like a whirlewind threw himſelf upon this Iſland ſo that all blooming Glories of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Greatneſs did wither and ſhrivell up, being ſuddenly nipt and blaſted by this Northern tempeſt. I ſhall not diſcypher the long, many, and impetuous encounters between theſe two fierce Nations, with the effuſion of Blood
<pb facs="tcp:103337:6"/>and the ruine and Depredation that diſcomplexioned every part of the Land; indeed, they are of ſo diſordered a Memory, and then ſo blended and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in the Perſons, Times, and Places, upon which the Scene of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Tragedies is intricately fixt, that it would be (as one well obſerves) ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther war to the Reader to over-look them. In brief, after a ſignal combat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally commenced between <hi>Edmund Ironſide</hi> and <hi>Canutus,</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Atheleny,</hi> both armies on either ſhore, being Spectators, the <hi>Saxon</hi> Diadem was by reciprocall compact to be devided between them: which after the deceaſe of <hi>Edmund Ironſide</hi> at <hi>Oxford;</hi> which, whether it were Naturall or Artificiall, is yet a controverſie, wholly inveſted the Temples of <hi>Canutus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! upon what a frail and incertain Pedeſtal is all humane greatneſs ſetled? For the luſtre of this new erected Monarchy had no ſooner diſplayed its beams in <hi>Canutus,</hi> but like an unthrifty Taper it began to glimmer in <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old,</hi> and abſolutely expired in <hi>Hardiknute,</hi> who dying iſſueleſs, the current of Royalty ran back again into the chanel of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Blood, which flow'd in the veins of <hi>Edward</hi> Sirnamed the <hi>Confeſſor;</hi> who likewiſe deceaſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> upon a pretended Donation from the laſt <hi>Edward</hi> entitles himſelf to the right and intereſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diadem.</p>
            <p>But this certainly was invail'd, for no Teſtamentary collation can ravell or diſorder ſucceſſion, which with an indiſſolueble link is chain'd and faſtned to the neareſt of Blood, and of which the Nation is to take the ſole and proper Cogniſance:) And to aſſert his title (which was fixt on the point of his ſword) he arives in <hi>Suſſex</hi> with a numerous Army, to check whoſe farther Progreſs in this Iſland, <hi>Harold</hi> advances likewiſe with a conſiderable Army (whoſe body had before evapourated its beſt and nobleſt Spirits at thoſe wounds which it before had received in a bloody encounter comenc'd with <hi>Harold Harſanger</hi> King of <hi>Norwey:</hi>) And nere that place where afterwards was founded the Abby of <hi>Battell,</hi> puts his claim to the Scepter, likewiſe to the Deciſion and Umpirage of the Sword, and after a fierce diſpute found the Tombe of his new purchas'd Royalty in the carriage of this Field, upon whoſe ruines, <hi>William</hi> now a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, climbs up the Aſcent of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne.</p>
            <p>His firſt deſign (after he had ſcatter'd all thoſe clouds of diſcontent that might have poſſibly have enwrapt the rays of acquired Majeſty in ſome new umbrage,) was to take a Survey of each mans particular intereſt and Patrimony, which was inroll d and recorded in a publique Regiſter commonly called <hi>Doomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> Book; upon pretence, that from a generall computation of the Revenue of the Nation, he might diſcern what ſtrength might be collected to intercept the violent attempts of any forain Invader upon this Iſland. But indeed to make a ſtrict inquiſition into the Forfeitures of the Lands of thoſe that had been in Hoſtility under the Enſignes of <hi>Harold</hi> againſt him, that with thoſe he might not onely endear and gratifie his Partiſans, but likewiſe by reinveſting the chiefeſt of his adverſaries in thoſe poſſeſſions which were by their Enmity eſcheated, oblige them to maintain his Title and Scepter. Yet it is obſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that he engag'd all thoſe that had receiv'd any Lands or Demeaſnes of him, either by any new conceſſion or re-inveſtiture to hold them in Eſcuage, that is by Knight Service, by which they were oblig'd whenſoever either publique neceſſity or his Commands did exact it of them, to attend his Perſon, either actually or virtually, that is by Proxie with Horſe and Armes; and by this art he had always a power in reſerve to repreſs and ſcatter all Solleviations or ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Inſurrections at home, and contradict all the Attempts and Animoſities of Adverſaries from abroad; that ſo he might become conſiderable to his enemies,
<pb facs="tcp:103337:7"/>and uſefull to his Friends. Thus have I compendiouſly wound up the ſeverall Invaſions made on this Iſland, in which <hi>Kent</hi> was ſo much concern'd. But there is another Invaſion that I have not yet numbred, which hath been more ruinous and diſtructive to the nobleſt Families of this Iſland than any of thoſe above recited: and that is the Riot and Exceſs, that like an Infectious Cloud, whoſe noyſome wombe drops nothing but diſeaſe and Peſtelence, hath lately broke in upon this Nation, and ſo withered the Root of the moſt ancient Gentry, that they have ſhrunk into their own ruines, and faln negelcted and forgotten: Indeed our modern Luxury is like the Poyſon of the Viper, it blaſts inviſibly, and diſtroys inſenſibly, and they that are ſoftned with it are like a Tree, that feeds thoſe wormes that muſt devoure it; or like Iron, that ſupplyes that ruſt which will corode it. Indeed 'tis obſervable, that thoſe Families have continued in their ſplendor longer whoſe ſeats and habitations have engag'd them to a remoter diſtance from the Verge and Sphere of the City, than thoſe whoſe Revenue and Patrimonie hath confin'd upon a place infected with ſo much Debaucherie, and let looſe into ſo great exceſs. Yet, 'tis remarkable that the cadets, or younger ſlips iſſued out from ſome of thoſe ſtems, who by their own vitious exorbitancie have crumbled into an inreparable decay, by being inoculated upon other Families, have by this tranſplantation contracted newſap and verdure, and again ſprouted out and floriſh'd. For Families are like the River of <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> they ſometimes ſink in one place or County, and again riſe in another.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now take the County of <hi>Kent</hi> under Survey or Proſpect, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the publique view, thoſe ſeveral Antiquities which in my ſearch I found to lie wrapt up either in common Records, or ſhut up in the private Muniments, Eſcripts, and Regiſters of particular Families; from whom I have endevour'd to pluck off the veil that they may for the future ſtand as an Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet to point out thoſe Families that are yet in being, that are totally exinguiſh'd or that lye entomb'd in other Names and Extractions, which by Mariage have ſwallowed up the Heir generall: In the purſuit of which I confeſs I have not cloiſter'd my ſelf up in the nice reſtraints of any preciſe or particular Method, becauſe that flood, both of private and publique inteligence, which like a Torrent broke in upon me, ſwept away whatſoever my buſie fancy had built upon the ſands of any curious or Methodical invention; But 'tis here, as in ſome Rivers who though they wander in a crooked and irregular chanell, yet are they the ſame Streames ſtill, as long as they hold correſpondence with their firſt Fountain and original.</p>
            <p>I ſhall remit all to the Juſtice and Candor of the Reader, with the firſt he may arraigne and cenſure, with the laſt abſolve and excuſe</p>

Beſides, every Lord and Maſter ſtood Borough for all his Family, whereof if any ſervant were cal'd in queſtion, the Maſter was to ſee him anſwer it in the HUNDRED where he was accus'd; if he fled, the Maſter was to reſigne ſuch goods as he had to the King: If himſelf were accus'd to be aiding or privy to his Servants flight, he was to clear himſelf by five men, otherwiſe to forfeit all his Goods to the King, and his man to be Outlawed. Theſe Links thus intermutually faſtned, made formerly ſo ſtrong a chain to hold the whole frame of the State toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Peace and order, as all the mingled policies upon Earth, all the inter-leagued Societies of Men cannot repreſent a ſtraiter Form of combination.</p>
               <p>As touching the other Cuſtomes of <hi>Kent,</hi> they have been ſo fully diſcuſs'd by Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> in his <hi>Kentiſh Perambulation,</hi> that I ſhall not much inſiſt in the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them: only I ſhall ſomething winnow the word <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> becauſe from that it is pretended the Tenure it ſelf is derived. Firſt, it is ſuggeſted, that the word <hi>Gavelkind</hi> is amaſs'd together of three <hi>Saxon</hi> Monoſyllables, that is to ſay, <hi>Goef ele Kent:</hi> but how this Cuſtome ſhould be originally eſtabliſhed on three Syllables by the corruption of Time thus crouded and ſhut up in one word, is altogether ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous and myſterious: For, if we ſhall unvail the word of its <hi>Saxon</hi> Habit, and put it into an Engliſh dreſs, it will ſignifie thus much, <hi>Give all Child;</hi> and how much nonſenſe lurks in that expreſſion, I think is eaſily diſcernable: Indeed the phraſe ſhould be, if we would attempt to ſpin any thing of advantage out of it, <hi>Goef ele Kendern, Give all Children,</hi> But how much of incongruitie and non-coherence lies wrapt up even in this, I beleeve is obvious enough; yet admit there were none, how four Syllables all of different vowels in their termination, ſhould at length by the depravation of Language be all confuſedly ſhuffled and ſtiv'd into this one word <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> will certainly appear to the moſt eaſie apprehenſion diſputable enough.</p>
               <p>For my own particular, I'm convinc'd (with ſubmiſſion to cleerer ſpeculations) that this word <hi>Gavelkind</hi> is derived from the <hi>Saxon</hi> word <hi>Gabel,</hi> which in the Latin we render <hi>Cenſus,</hi> and put into Engliſh ſignifies ſome Rent-Service, or Tribute iſſuable from ſuch and ſuch Land, on which it is fixt as a ſolemn evidence of ſome homage due to the Prince or ſupreme Magiſtrate, for that ſecurity which is received both in life and propriety by his defence and tuition. And certainly this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing proportionate to Reaſon; for all <hi>Gavelkind</hi>-Land is held in the Tenure of free-Soccage, which is charg'd with this manner of Rent-charge or impoſition; and ſo in ſeveral Latine Records is repreſented under the Notion of <hi>Terra Cenſualis.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103337:8"/>
               <p>'Tis true, that by the ancient cuſtome of <hi>Germany,</hi> cal'd <hi>Land-Skiftan,</hi> the Lands of the deceaſed was by equal portions to be diſtributed amongſt all the Sons; but then it is as probable that this Tribute or <hi>Gabel</hi> did accompany it, becauſe the moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of this Cuſtome hath through the Channel of many hundred years flow'd down to this preſent Age, and is in force in ſundry places in <hi>Germany</hi> at this inſtant: For though the Hernelickheis or Lordſhip, as they ſtyle it, deſcend Patrimonially <hi>per Jus Dominatus,</hi> by the right of Signorie to the elder Son, yet all the Land ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſiely from that is equally divided between the Cadets or younger Brothers, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returning ſome inconſiderable Rent-Service to the Prince, as a character of that Fealtie thy owe him for ſheltring them in their ſeveral Patrimonies by his mutual ſupport and protection.</p>
               <p>Certain it is when <hi>Hengiſt</hi> tranſported his <hi>Saxons</hi> firſt into <hi>Britain,</hi> that Cuſtome of <hi>Land-Skiftan</hi> was wafted over with them, and was by him allow'd to his Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Partiſans when they were inveſted in their new Acquiſts and Poſſeſſions in <hi>Kent,</hi> as all other Franchiſes and Immunities were, which before in <hi>Germany</hi> they were by preſcription endow'd with, that they might more vigorouſly improve his deſignes upon this Iſland; yet ſtill it is poſſible he reſerved out of thoſe <hi>Demeaſnes</hi> thus by Grant couveyed to his complices, ſome Annual Tax or Gabel (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of a low and narrow value) as a ſignal acknowledgement that the Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Soveraignty was ſolely lodg'd in him.</p>
               <p>There are two other Cuſtomes which are properly calculated for the Meridian of <hi>Romeney Marſh,</hi> and perhaps through inadvertency were not recited by Mr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> and they are theſe: Firſt, the King had anciently no Waſt there, and ſecondly he had no Wracks, but they were appropriated to thoſe Mannors of the <hi>Merſh</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd on the Sea; and ſurely if we fathom their original we ſhall find their foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſtabliſhed on much of Reaſon. For firſt, how could the Crown entitle it ſelf to any Waſt there, where the Sea by its impetuous encroachments did engage the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to caſt up Mounts, and erect Banks in any place which they ſhould find moſt proportionate to their defence againſt the fury of ſo formidable an adverſary? For the ſecond, it is very equitable that they that are intereſſed in an expence of that vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in which the Publique (by the obligation of neceſſary conſequences) is ſo much concern'd and wrapt up, ſhould have ſomething of Emolument indulged to them by the careful Munificence of the Prince, to poiſe and ballance thoſe important diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements which the ill neighbourhood of the Ocean does oblige them to, in fortifying the <hi>Merſh</hi> with perpetual Defences and Dams againſt its aſſaults and eruptions. Having thus diſcovered ſomething in relation to the Cuſtoms of <hi>Kent,</hi> before I advance farther into the Land, I ſhall repreſent what care our former Kings have embarqu'd themſelves in, to ſecure the Sea, by fixing Sea-watches and other Military Guards upon all the Avennues and Inlets of the Coaſt, to repreſſe and check the attempts of any bold Intruder, as if their own ſafety and indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were folded up in the ſecurity of this County.</p>
               <p>Touching then Sea-watches upon the Coaſt, there are three Preſidents, and a Mandate from the King to the Sheriff in a time of a more modern inſcription for performing the like ſervice. The firſt containing the watch by night in Record is ſtyled <hi>Vigiliae minutae,</hi> which are due of right and cuſtome to be made by the Men of certain HUNDREDS, as by the Title thereof, and the Writ for Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the ſame may appear.</p>
               <p>The ſecond concluding the Day-watch, hence called <hi>Wardan</hi> is arbitrary, and at the pleaſure of thoſe which in time of war and common danger had authority to appoint them, of theſe there are three examples, one of the 9 of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. (which I intend principally to trace, as being the original to the other) which year he made preparation to invade <hi>France,</hi> and to vindicate his Title to the Crown, and the other the 20. of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. in which year he ſailed into <hi>France</hi> and triumphed in the Signal battail of <hi>Creſcey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third deſcribeth to whoſe charge ſeveral parts of the ſhore were aſſign'd for defence, in the 29, of <hi>Fdward</hi> the 3. At what time he paſt into <hi>France</hi> and was victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the Encounter of <hi>Poictiers.</hi> It diſcovers alſo what parts of the Shire were to reſort to the Coaſt for protection of the ſame. This order is arbitrary alſo,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103337:9"/>as they that in the Record are ſtyl'd <hi>Rectores Comitatus</hi> (that is, Lieutenants of the Shire) ſhall think meet to appoint.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rex Vicecomiti Kantii ſalutem. Quia datum eſt nobis intelligi quod nonnulli inimici noſtri ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Mare ſe tenentes, regnum noſtrum Angliae in diverſis locis ingredi intendunt, &amp;c.

Teſte me ipſo apud Weſtm. quarto die Auguſti. Anno Regni noſtri</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>Becauſe there hath been frequent mention of <hi>Hobilers</hi> in the aboveſaid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I ſhall diſcover to the Reader a brief portraiture of them, as I have copied it by that Original which hath been pencil'd out by the learned induſtry of Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his <hi>Gloſſarie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word <hi>Hobiler,</hi> ſayes he, is derived from the French word <hi>Hobill,</hi> which imports as much as a light quilted Caſſock; and indeed all the Latine Records ſay they ſhould be <hi>Wampaſa armati,</hi> which ſignifies or denotes a Jack; and in ſome parts both of <hi>Germany</hi> and the Low Countreys, at this day <hi>Wampas</hi> is us'd to expreſs a Doublet or a ſhort Caſſock: and if you will know with what Horſe they were equip'd or furniſh'd for ſervice, the aboveſaid Author will tell you, that every <hi>Hobiler</hi> ſhould be <hi>Mediocri eque inſtructus, &amp; ad omnem motum agili;</hi> a Horſe of no great proportion, but light, and fitted for all manner of ſervice.</p>
               <p>Having repreſented to the Reader how ſedulous the Princes of this Nation were in Modern times to ſecure the Maritime ſhores of <hi>Kent,</hi> which like a Girdle of ſand almoſt inveſt this County, I ſhall now diſcover briefly and in Landskip how they were guarded, fortified, and preſerved in times of an elder Inſcription; which diſcourſe I ſhall marſhall under the Notion of <hi>Littus Saxonicum.</hi>

               <p>As for that Officer called the Serjeant of the Horn, be it underſtood as an ancient note of the Ports tenure by Cornage, from King <hi>Canutus</hi> time, by which, as the beſt Cuſtomals of the Cinque Ports inform me there Moots and publick Aſſemblies are ſummoned, <hi>Sonitu Cornu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having entred into a Diſcourſe of the Cinque Ports, I ſhall take a farther propſect of thoſe privileges they were inveſted with, from or before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, eſpecially by that ſignall Charter, which was granted to them in the 20 year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt. Firſt, then they were exempted from all Taxes and Tallages, that they might with more vigor and alacriry be encouraged and emboldened to attend the publique Service.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they had <hi>Sac</hi> and <hi>Soc, Sac</hi> is a privilege to take Cogniſance of cauſes either Criminal or Civil within their own Courts, <hi>Soc</hi> is a power planted in them to compel all perſons which live within the Confines of their Liberties, to plead in their Courts, and from hence anciently they were called <hi>Socmanni,</hi> that is, Suiters to that Court, where they were forced to plead.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they had <hi>Toll</hi> and <hi>Theam, Toll</hi> was a Liberty of buying and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling within their own juisdiction, and a power to receive the <hi>Toll</hi> or <hi>Gabel</hi> impoſed on commodities there vended. <hi>Theam</hi> is both a civil and coercive power or jurisdiction ſettled in them by Charter, over all thoſe who are inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, or any of the limbs or members of them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they had <hi>Bloodwith</hi> and <hi>Fledwith, Bloodwith</hi> is a power to puniſh the effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Blood; <hi>Fledwith</hi> is an authority to puniſh thoſe who having committed any miſdemeanor or outrage, and ſeeking to ſecure themſelves by flight, are again ſeiſed upon, and offered up to deſerved Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, they had <hi>Pillorie</hi> and <hi>Tumbrell, Tumbrell</hi> was an Engine much reſembling our Cucking-ſtool, and was inſtituted to reſtrain the fury of loud clamorous and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Women.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, they had <hi>Infangetheof</hi> and <hi>Cutfangetheof,</hi> that is a power to impriſon, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103337:12"/>upon juſt and legal evidence (which is the Lanthorn of the Law) to execute all thoſe, though Forainers and Aliens which ſhould commir any felony in places ſubject to their juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, they had <hi>Mundbriech;</hi> that is, a priviledge to raiſe banks and mounds on any perſons land whatſoever, whoſe proprietie lay within their juriſdiction, to ſecure the common Intereſt from the eruptions and caſuall Inundations of the Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Eightly, they had <hi>Waives,</hi> called by a generall name in old Law-Latin <hi>Weveragium,</hi> and <hi>Strays Waives</hi> was a word of a common latitude, uſed to ſignifie all thoſe things, either wandering Chattel, or other goods, which being waved or loſt, and not claimed within a year and a day, were to be poſſeſt by thoſe within whoſe juriſdiction they were ſeis'd, according to that of the Civill Law, <hi>Quae nullius juris ſunt, &amp; pro derelictis habentur, cedunt occupanti.</hi> Strays is a word of a more circumſcrib'd and reſtrained ſenſe, relating only to ſtragling Cattel; to whom if none did entitle themſelves by claim in a year and a day, their propriety was inveſted in thoſe who poſſeſt them.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, they had <hi>Waſte</hi> and <hi>Strep,</hi> or Eſtrepment Waſte was that parcell of common earth which by preſcription and cuſtome belonged to the Crown, but by Charter was enſtated on them. <hi>Strip</hi> or <hi>Eſtrepment</hi> is a power granted to them to cut down Trees within their own juriſdiction, without impeachment of waſte.</p>
               <p>In the tenth place, they had the grant of <hi>Flotſom, Jetſom, Witſom: Flotſom</hi> were goods upon ſome viſible wrack floating to the ſhore <hi>Jetſom,</hi> were goods in a ſtorme thown over board to preſerve the Ship, and ſinking did again buoy up themſelves, anr were again by the agitation of the waves thrown on the Strand. <hi>Witſom</hi> were goods driven to the ſhore, when there had not been for ſome ſpace any wrack viſible; from whence they were anciently ſtyled Goods of Gods mercy; <hi>Wit,</hi> in old Engliſh importing as much as <hi>Miſericordia</hi> in Latin.</p>
               <p>Their eleventh priviledge was to be a <hi>Guild,</hi> that is a Fraternity or Combination of men that had all the Franchiſes of Court-Leet and Court-Baron annex'd to them; as likewiſe they were endow'd with a power upon emergent occaſions to improve the common intereſt, to lay Aſſeſſements and Taxes upon the Inhabitants of the Cinque Ports and their Members; the word <hi>Guild</hi> being extracted from an old Latin word called <hi>Geldo,</hi> which ſignifies to tax.</p>
               <p>Their twelfth Franchiſe was, to aſſemble at <hi>Shepway,</hi> which was anciently called the Portmote or Parliament of the Cinque Ports; there they puniſh'd the infringers of their priviledges, and amerc'd all thoſe who being Inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, or of thoſe Towns which were circumſcrib'd within their Juriſdiction, ſued out of thoſe Courts which were properly eſtabliſhed to hear and determine all cauſes ariſing within their Liberties; here likewiſe they had Authority, by Royall Conceſſion, to make By-Laws and Ordinances, for the common good and profit of the Cinque Ports, and for the better Regulating (as the exigency of Affairs might ſeem to exact) the Herring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhing at <hi>Yarmouth;</hi> and that this Court in the power of it might appear to be the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpane of that great Original of Power, the high Court of Parliament, all appeals from the inferior and ſubordinate Courts of the Cinque Ports were tranſmitted and transfer'd to this of <hi>Shepway.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Barons of the Cinque Ports claim by inherent Cuſtome and Preſcription, which is grown up and confirm'd by a tacite conſent between them and the King, to ſupport the four Staves of the Canopy that covers the Kings Head at his Coronation, and after to dine at the uppermoſt Table in the great Hall, on his right hand.</p>
               <p>There are other Franchiſes and priviledges circumſcrib'd within the Verge and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the above-recite a Charter, as the taking cognizance of the Aſſize of Bread and Beer, and ſome others; which becauſe they are not of that importance or conſideration as thoſe which before were rehearſed, and moreover finding that they are calculated for the Meridian of many other Corporations beſides that of the Cinque Ports, I have at preſent forbore any farther Recital of them.</p>
               <p>Now if any one will enquire what the Cinque Ports were to act by way of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence or retribution for theſe ſo ſolemn and ſignall Characters and Demonſtrations of royal favour; To this I anſwer, That they were to find fifty and ſeven Ships at their own Charge, for the ſpace of fifteen days, to attend the King whenſoever he ſhould paſs the Seas; whereof <hi>Haſting</hi> was to find one and twenty, <hi>Sandwich</hi> five, <hi>Hieth</hi> five, <hi>Romney</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103337:13"/>five, and <hi>Dover</hi> one and twenty; each of which was to be furniſhed with one and twenty men, and a <hi>Garcion</hi> or Boy, the Maſters ſtipend was to amount to 6<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Conſtables to a Sallary of the ſame value, and each vulgar Mariner was to have three pence <hi>per diem;</hi> and if the obligation of affairs ſo requir'd it that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the King beyond the extent of fifteen days, then they were for the time fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to be ſupported in their expences at the charge of the Crown. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wiſdome of after-times thought this too vaſt and burdenſome an expence, to be ſolely and wholly ſuſtain'd by the Cinque-Ports, therefore there were ſeveral other Towns and Villges that lay ſcatter'd in the Body of this Nation, that were made Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Limbs of the Cinque-Ports, and inveſted and fortified with the ſame Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and Liberties, that they might by conſequence be enwrapt and engag'd in the ſame common expence. The Names of thoſe which are ſituated in <hi>Kent</hi> are as followeth: <hi>viz. Sandwich</hi> had the Addition of <hi>Fordwich, Sarre, Ramſgate, Deal, Walmer,</hi> and <hi>Stonor. Dover</hi> had <hi>Feverſham, Birchington,</hi> St. <hi>Johns,</hi> St. <hi>Peters, Ridlings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>would,</hi> and <hi>Folkstone. Hieth</hi> had Weſt-<hi>Hieth. Romney</hi> had old <hi>Romney, Lydde, Prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, Dengemerſh,</hi> and <hi>Orwelſton. Haſtings</hi> and <hi>Winchelſey</hi> had in <hi>Kent</hi> as their Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages, <hi>Bekesbourn, Grench,</hi> and <hi>Tenterden.</hi> As a L'envoy to the Cinque-Ports, I ſhall repreſent a Summary, or Bedroll of all thoſe Perſons of eſteem that have had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to have been dignified with the Title of Lord Wardens of the Cinque-Ports; which Scroll or Regiſter I have collected out of an ancient Manuſcript, and are in their <hi>Series</hi> or Succeſſion as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <hi>Egbert</hi> having thus broken the Kentiſh Forces, and inoculated the Scepter of <hi>Kent</hi> upon that of his own, the Title of King was for ever entomb'd in the Ruines and Tomb of the ſlaughter'd <hi>Baldred;</hi> nor was this County dignified with any Title at all, untill the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, and then that Prince created <hi>Godwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent;</hi> a man of ſo low and obſcure an extraction, that the concurrent Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of all Authors does affirm he was <hi>Bubulci Filius,</hi> the ſon of a Cowherd: yet notwithſtanding, he made himſelf ſo conſiderable by his Eruptions on ſeveral parts of this Iſland by Land, and his depredations by Sea, that our Engliſh ſtory ſwels with the rehearſal of his Acts of Devaſtation and Piracy. Now if you would know from whence the Latine word <hi>Comes</hi> deduces its original, that is, the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> both to the French word <hi>Count,</hi> and the Saxon word <hi>Earle</hi> or <hi>Eorlederman,</hi> (for that was the more antient term;) I ſhall in a brief Model repreſent it to you. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Counts</hi> anciently, as is affirmed by <hi>Trebellius Pollio</hi> in the life of <hi>Macrianus,</hi> was in <hi>Contubernium Imperatoriae Majeſtatis adſciſcere,</hi> to take ſome ſelect Perſons into the Chamber and fellowſhip of the Imperial Majeſty: that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had ſome ſuch, is moſt certain; for, <hi>Suetonius</hi> in his life mentions <hi>Comites Largitionum expeditionumque;</hi> whoſe firſt inſtitution is by <hi>Seneca</hi> in his ſixth Book <hi>de Bene. Cap.</hi> 34. refer'd and aſcrib'd to <hi>Gracchus</hi> and <hi>Livius Druſus;</hi> they, ſaith he, <hi>apud nos primum inſtituerunt ſegregare Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam ſuam, &amp; alios in ſecretum recipere:</hi> and then again, <hi>Habuerunt itaque iſti amicos pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos, habuerunt &amp; ſecundos;</hi> and it is recorded of <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> by <hi>Lampridius,</hi> that <hi>Amicos non ſolùm primi ac ſecundi loci</hi> (which were certainly thoſe perſons which he had ſeparated from the vulgar maſſe of men) <hi>ſed etiam inferiores aegrotantes viſeret.</hi> And <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his Book de <hi>Bello Germanice</hi> relates, that the Prince had <hi>duodecem Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> or twelve Companions aſſign'd him, who tranſacted the great Affairs both of War and Peace; from which Model it is probable the 12 Peers of <hi>France</hi> had their firſt original. In Ages of a lower ſtep, theſe <hi>Comites</hi> were frequently call'd <hi>Reguli.</hi> In <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> ſaith <hi>Malmsbury, Omnis juſtitia laborabat ſub cujuſdam Gorongiregimine, qui tamen ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut omnes Reguli inſulae Vortigerno ſubſternebantur.</hi> Afterwards when <hi>Hengiſt</hi> had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103337:14"/>his Kentiſh Kingdome, the Title of Earl began to commence in <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Ebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> Brothers to the aboveſaid <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Malmesbury</hi> obſerves in his Tract <hi>de Geſtis Regum Cap.</hi> 3. And the Title of Earl was anciently expreſſed by the word <hi>Comes</hi> amongſt the Saxons, for to King <hi>Ethelberts</hi> Charter for the foundation of the <hi>Abby</hi> of St. <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> cited by <hi>Reynerus,</hi> there are theſe ſubſcriptions, <hi>Ego Hamigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Dux laudavi,</hi> and then, <hi>Ego Ocea Comes conſenſi, Ego Graphio Comes benedixi;</hi> and there is an old Epitaph quoted by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Titles of Honour,</hi> the ſubſtance of which is this; that <hi>Alwain</hi> which was Founder of <hi>Ramſey-Abby,</hi> was <hi>Comes &amp; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermannus totius Angliae:</hi> but in decurſion of Time, this word <hi>Eolderman</hi> being uſed by others beſides thoſe to whom it was proper and analogical, it began to languiſh into diſuſe, and the Title of <hi>Thane</hi> and <hi>Earl</hi> was aſſumed, which laſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in force untill this day: Now the relief of a <hi>Thane</hi> (who was certainly an Earl by office, rather then Title) if he were of the firſt rank, that is, had the cuſtody of ſome County under the King, which he paid to the Crown, was four Horſes two ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and two unſadled: two Swords, and four Spears, and as many Shields; And if he were of the ſecond rank, he paid two Horſes, one ſadled and one unſadled, one Sword, two Lances, as many Shields, and fifty Marks in Silver; ſometimes, if he were a <hi>Thane</hi> of an inferior rank, he paid eight-pound, and frequently three-pound. The relief which an Earl paid conſtantly to the Crown after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt was (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Titles of Honour,</hi> does demonſtrate out of ſeverall Records) was an Hundred pound.</p>
               <p>Now the benefit which did accrue to the <hi>Count</hi> or <hi>Earl,</hi> beſides a Barren and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Title to ſupport the dignity of his Perſon in its due Magnificence and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, was the third penny ariſing out of the Profits of the County. <hi>Algar</hi> Earl of <hi>Merc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (as <hi>Dooms-day</hi> Book informs us) had the third penny of the County of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and the Borough of <hi>Stafford</hi> under <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor. And <hi>Mawde</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe when ſhe created <hi>Milo</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> aſſigned to him for the ſupport of his Honor, the third penny of that County: Many examples of the like condition are diſcoverable in Mr. <hi>Selden's Titles of Honour,</hi> whither I refer the Reader. And as they had the third penny, ſo they had frequently the Caſtle of the County annexed to their Title, but when by experience the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were inſtructed how fatally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious it was to have ſo many local powers concurrent with theirs, that by the ſtrength of their retreat, and the number of confederates and Partiſans, ſeem'd even to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe the Royal Authority, it was by a Statute made in the 13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> year of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> for the future interdicted and prohibited.</p>
               <p>Now if you will enquire when Earls or Counts from being abſolute became Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, Sr. <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his <hi>Gloſſarie</hi> will tell you that it was <hi>Tempore Othonum, &amp; ſub exceſſu Merovinae ſtirpis in Galliâ,</hi> that is, about the year onet houſand.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning the Enſigns of Inveſtiture, with which the Earl was created, it was anciently only with the Cincture of a Sword, but about the latter end of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the firſt, the Coronet began to be in uſe, for <hi>Aymer de Vallence</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> who died in the 16<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> year of <hi>Edward</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> had one, as appears by an inſtrument of <hi>William de Lavenham,</hi> cited by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Titles of Honour,</hi> by which he acknowledges the receit of it from Sr. <hi>Henry Stacheden</hi> in the 12<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> year of <hi>Edward</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> 
                  <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> died in the 49<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> year of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> and by his laſt Will dated the fifth of <hi>December,</hi> gives his Nobleſt and Richeſt Coronet to his Son the Lord <hi>Richard Fitz-allan,</hi> his ſecond to the Lady <hi>Joan</hi> his eldeſt, and the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queaths to the Lady <hi>Alice</hi> his youngeſt Daughter.</p>
               <p>What the <hi>Counts Palatine</hi> were I ſhall now demonſtrate: they were taken immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>à Palatio,</hi> from whence they aſſum'd their name; and were cuſtomarily ſuch as had the neareſt relation to the Prince, either by friendſhip or Affinity, and to whoſe care and adminiſtration, he did entruſt ſuch or ſuch a Province; and the more to improve and enable them in the diſcharge of their Duty, did unite ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Franchiſes to their office; as erecting Courts of Judicature, appointing Judges to ſit in them, and determine by ſignal deciſion upon cauſes both Criminal and Civil, and others of the like nature, that were of that luxutiant latitude, that they had the Stamp and Character of ſomething which reſembled Regality fixt upon them. He that will diſcover by example more of this honorary Title may read Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103337:15"/>Titles of Honor</hi> whither, to decline all ſuperfluity of diſcourſe, I refer to the Reader.</p>
               <p>I have now done with the Title, I ſhall now proceed to unwind the Regiſter of thoſe who were Earls of <hi>Kent</hi> ſubſequent to Earl <hi>Godwin.</hi>

And we find <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> made his Son Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the five laſt years of his Reign, Sheriff of <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Buckingham.</hi> The black Prince was often Sheriff of <hi>Cornwall</hi> under <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> And Prince <hi>Henry</hi> in the life of his Father <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> is found to have been Sheriff of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and it was done by theſe Sagacious Princes, with this intent, that their Sons, when they ſhould aſcend the Throne, might be more dexterous in the Courſe and Conduct of the revenue of the Crown. And as theſe Princes were inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with this Office, ſo we find both Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Earls, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons held this Dignity; nay, ſometimes Queens and Counteſſes, Dowagers too, with an allowance of a Shire-Clerk, which after reſolv'd into him, we call the under-Sheriff. And it was uſual long ſince, as the Statute-Law now likewiſe aſſerts it, that the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> or Poſſeſſion of ſome <hi>Demeaſne</hi> in the County, admits a capacity to hold the office, and anſwer the King the Profits of the County; otherwiſe, they are illegal
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103337:15"/>and lyable to exception; and in this reſpect, ſometime the King committed four Counties to one man, if he were poſſeſt of Lands in them all, as <hi>Hubert de Burgo</hi> was at one time Sheriff of <hi>Kent, Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and was allow'd a meet perſon to be his Subſtitute or Shire-Clerk in the ninth of <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhall demand how long there have been Sheriffs under this quallified No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I have before repreſented and pourtray'd them, I muſt remit them to King <hi>Alfred</hi> the Founder of <hi>Englands</hi> peace, and the divider of it into Shires and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; not to <hi>Gervas</hi> of <hi>Tilbury,</hi> whoſe definition of the Name is very deficient, making the office meerly ſuppletory to the Count or Earl, nor to <hi>Polidore Virgil,</hi> who being by birth an <hi>Alien,</hi> would obtrude a falſe opinion upon us, that the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Chancellors and Sheriffs were inſtituted ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt; For evidence to the confutation of him, we may read the Teſtimonies remembred by the moſt learned <hi>Selden,</hi> in the ſubſcription of King <hi>Edreds</hi> Charter, to the Abby of <hi>Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> there after Abbots, Dukes and Counts follow, <hi>Ego Afor vice Comes audivi.</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> And in another Saxon Charter, to the ſame Abby there is this clauſe inſerted, <hi>Ego Livingus Clericus iſtud Chirographum manu meâ ſubſcripſi, &amp; Domino meo Theroldo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didi;</hi> which Records do indiſputably, I think ſubvert his Aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>The next Annotation upon our proconſulary Officer, is the continuation of thoſe that in elder time held it many years together; as for example, the <hi>Cornhills</hi> did in <hi>Kent,</hi> whereby their own Sirname was diſcontinued, and the officiary Name <hi>le Sheriff, &amp; le Viſcount</hi> ſwallowed up the other, and the relict of Reginald <hi>(de Cornhill) le Viſcount,</hi> in a Conceſſion of Land to the Chappel of <hi>Lukedale</hi> in <hi>Littlebourn,</hi> is ſtyl'd in the Latine Inſtrument <hi>Vice Comitiſſa Cantii,</hi> and a Mannor of his in <hi>Minſter</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> has from this Sirname obtain'd the Title of the Sheriffs Court. But when it was found inconvenient for one man to hold the place any long time, in regard of his Account, and other enormities emergent; proviſion was made by Statute that none ſhould ſerve two years together, but ſhould be two years at leaſt deveſted of the Office ere he ſerved again in the ſame County.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Sheriffs Letters of attendance, injoyning all Arch-Biſhops, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts, Biſhops, Barons, &amp;c. to aſſiſt him, it ſhews in <hi>Lankskip</hi> and <hi>Perſpective</hi> afar off, the Latitude anciently of his authority; but ſince the inſtitution of Lords-Lieutenants, the Beams of his power have ſhone forth with a more dim and contracted light: So much ſhall ſuffice for the explication of its Name, as it is Officiary. Now a word or two how it became Honorary, becauſe as from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul or Count, Time and Royal Authority hath extracted the Princely Dignity of Earl, which being for the moſt part enſtated in elder times on the Kings kindred, hath cauſed the uſe of that addition ever ſince to all of that rank: So likewiſe the State and Degree of a <hi>Vicount,</hi> hath a participation of that Attribute, and are call'd Couſen by the Soveraign, and in the Scrutiny made by the Chancellor of the Order of the Garter at every Feaſt of St. <hi>George,</hi> during the time of <hi>Veſpers,</hi> if there were any ſtall void; A <hi>Viſcount</hi> is admitted as the loweſt degree of Princes. The firſt that under this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle had Parliamentary Dignity and Precedency of all Barons with us, was <hi>John de Beaumont</hi> created <hi>Viſcount-Beaumont</hi> in the 18<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Office. The Circle or Coronet of this Degree being by its figure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from an Earls, as a Marqueſſes is from a Dukes. They that would take an exact ſurvey of the official part of this ancient Miniſter in all its Dimenſions and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages, let them conſult <hi>Dalton,</hi> who has very exactly and uſefully diſcovered to the world all the Ingredients which make up this Office.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall before I proceed to draw out the Catalogue of the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Sheriffs, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the world a ſummary Liſt of Arch-Biſhops, Earls, Biſhops, and others of high eminence, which manag'd this Office, either perſonally or virtually; as well in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Counties as in <hi>Kent.</hi> And firſt, Queen <hi>Iſabel</hi> had the Sheriffwick of <hi>Cornwall</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers years before her Husband <hi>Edward</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> was thruſt out of the world by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural death, and ſome years under the Reign of her Son King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of King <hi>John,</hi> and Sheriff of <hi>Lincoln</hi> ſix or ſeven years together: The Earls of <hi>Warwick</hi> were often Sheriffs of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire</hi> under <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> and alſo of the County of <hi>Worceſter</hi> moſt part of that Kings Reign; indeed the office of Sheriff was ſo frequent in that Family that it almoſt appear'd to be Hereditary to the <hi>Beauchamps: Ralph</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> was Sheriff of that County the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and of the County of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> the ſecond year of the ſame King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walter</hi> Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>Nottingham</hi> the fifty fourth and fifty fifth of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Hugo de Stapleford</hi> was his Shire-Clerk; <hi>Hillarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> the ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Ralph Regnald</hi> was his Shire-Clerk. <hi>Hillarius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Surry</hi> the eight of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> was often Sheriff of the County of <hi>Dorſet</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and of <hi>Hampſhire</hi> at the ſame time. <hi>Joceline</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bath,</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>Somerſet</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> the firſt eigth years of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. <hi>Walter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle</hi> was frequently Sheriff of <hi>Cumberland</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Robert</hi> his ſucceſſor was often Sheriff of the ſame County under <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt; and both of them had their Shire-Clerks. <hi>Walter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Liechfield,</hi> was often in this office under <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt in the County of <hi>Stafford.

                  <p>Many more Preſidents of this Nature could be unfolded, but I think theſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Teſtimonies enough to diſcover both the Dignity and Eminence of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and illuſtrous office; only this may be deduc'd from theſe examples: That ſome Counties heretofore were joyned with their next Neighbors for eaſe of the ſervice, as <hi>Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Surry, Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwall, Somerſet</hi> and <hi>Dorſet, Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Wilts, Warwick</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter, Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon, Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk, Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> &amp;c. moſt of which were ſeparated by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the reſt taken in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the late King <hi>Charles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall now endevour to unravel the Catalogue of the Sheriffs of <hi>Kent,</hi> as I find them Regiſtred either in the Pipe-Rolls, or other Evidences; and I have as much as poſibly I could, Recorded the places where they inhabited, which will much improve and inforce that light which I am to diſtribute to the world: in Relation to thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I am in my ſubſequent diſcourſe to treat upon.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, I find <hi>Oſward</hi> a Saxon held divers Lands in <hi>Kent,</hi> as <hi>Herſt, Hagalei, Norton, Chert, Stepedon,</hi> with <hi>Tunſdal,</hi> and <hi>Tong,</hi> during the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor; all which Lands were in the Conquerors Time, poſſeſt by <hi>Hugo de Port:</hi> This <hi>Oſward</hi> alſo held <hi>Delce Hadon, Alneiton</hi> and <hi>Har &amp; Sham.</hi> He was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> under the Confeſſor, as appears by the prime Record of the Nation, <hi>Domes day Book,</hi> where ſpeaking of <hi>Tarentford</hi> in <hi>Axtan</hi> Hundred it is thus entred, <hi>Homines de in Hundredo teſtificantur, quod de iſto Manerio Regis ablatum eſt unum Pratum, &amp; unum Alnetum, &amp; unum Molendinum &amp; XX. acrae Prati, &amp;c.

Ordaining that their ſhould be in every Shire one Lord, and with him three or four of the beſt in the County, and three or four learned in the Laws aſſigned for keeping of the Peace, and to reſtrain Offenders.

                  <p>After by the Statute of the twelfth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. and the fourteenth year of the ſame Prince, <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. it was prohibited that there ſhould be any more than ſix Juſtices of the Peace in any Commiſſion beſides the two Juſtices of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſe, and certain Lords who were aſſigned in the Parliament it ſelf. But in Times ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to theſe, when the Womb of Vice (like the Mudde of <hi>Nile</hi>) was more fertile in the production of Crimes, and the Seeds of Contention began to be ſown more plentifully in every furrow of this Nation, which ſprang up again in a numberleſs Variety of Diſcord and Animoſity; theſe Reſtrictions were broke, and the Catalogue of Juſtices was improved to that Volume, to which it is ſwoln at preſent.</p>
                  <p>Before I deſcend to a particular Deſcription of the Pariſhes of this County, I ſhould take cogniſance of all thoſe Towns and Villages which by the indulgence of former Princes were inveſted with the Charter of Market and Faire:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>But this hath been ſo exactly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Mr.</hi> Kilbourn, <hi>that I ſhall at preſent decline this Task.</hi>
                     </note> Indeed all of them had this Paſſage inſerted in the Original Grant, <hi>Quantum in Nobis eſt,</hi> ſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them when they came to be diſcuſſed before the Judges <hi>Itinerent</hi> at the general Aſſiſes, <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> they were held, that is to ſay, what Authority they had to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, were if they were found convenient and neceſſary ratified, confirmed, and continued; but if again they were deemed needleſs and ſuperfluous, they were at theſe publick Conventions by the power of the Law then planted in the Judges, vacated and diſcarded, This may likewiſe be added, that many of them were granted with this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103337:26"/>Intention of their firſt Inſtitution only to inforce and Aggrandize the Signorie of thoſe Mannors which were parcel of the Demeaſn of thoſe eminent Perſons to whom thoſe above mentioned Royal Charters and Conceſſions were indulged; as, <hi>Sutton Valence, Court at Sreet, Shinglewell,</hi> and others; and when the Title and Poſſeſſion of thoſe Places was either by Purchaſe or Marriage caſt into the Tenure of other Proprietaries, the Virtue of theſe Grants began to be diſ-ſpirited, and the Cuſtome of Keeping up Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and Fairs at theſe Mannors and Pariſhes began inſenſibly to ſhrink into diſuſe and intermiſſion. It is farther obſervable, that at diverſe Places which were endowed with theſe above mentioned Priviledges, as, at <hi>Brenchly, Charlton</hi> by <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and other Pariſhes, the Market and Fair was obſerved and held in the Church-yard, and on the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; it being the great Deſign of the Romiſh Clergie of thoſe cloudy Times, to whom Godlineſs was great gain, in the practical ſenſe, at once to charm the peoples Devotion and Benevolence: But, as if there were in the Vogue and Eſtimate of that Age, a greater Degree of Sanctity entailed on the Church-yard, then on the Sunday, the holding either Market or Fair in that Place was by a Statute made in the thirteenth year of <hi>Ed.</hi> the firſt, Chapter the ſixth, wholly interdicted and prohibited; but though the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard were thus empaled, and fenced in with this new Law, the Sunday lay open and expoſed to all Diſorder and Prophanation, untill the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then that pious Prince reſenting with regret the many Enormities and other Exceſſes of a black Complexion, which were occaſioned by the Conflux of people aſſembled at theſe publick Meetings, and which had foully ſtained and debauched the purity of this Solemn Feſtival, did by Statute made and ratified in the twenty ſeventh year of his Reign, Chapter the fifth, for the future forbid the keeping of any Markets or Fairs in any Place whatſoever on the Sunday.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now take a Proſpect of all the Pariſhes, Villages, and Mannors, which are circumſcribed, within the circle of this County; but before I wade farther in this Diſcourſe, I ſhall repreſent upon what reaſons or foundations Mannors were firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and eſtabliſhed, by example and reſemblance of the King's policy in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Tenures, (ſaith Sir <hi>Francis Bacon:</hi>) The great men and Gentlemen of this Realm did the like, ſo near as they could; as for Example, when the King had given to any of them two thouſand Acres of Lands, this party propoſing in this place to make his Dwelling, or (as the old word is) his Manſion-houſe, or his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor-houſe, did deviſe how he might make his Land a compleat Habitation to ſupply him with all manner of neceſſaries; and for that purpoſe, he would give of the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of theſe two thouſands Acres, one hundred, or two hundred Acres, or more or leſs, as he ſhould think meet, to one of his moſt truſty Servants, with ſome reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of rent to find a horſe for the wars, and go with him when he went with the King to the wars, adding vow of Homage, and the oath of Fealty, Wardſhip, Marriage and Relief. This Relief is to pay five pounds for every Knights Fee, or after the rate for more or leſs at the entrance of every Heir: which Tenant ſo created and placed, was, and is to this day called a Tennant by Knights Service, and not by his own perſon; but of his Mannors, of theſe he might make as many as he would; then this Lord would provide that the Land which he was to keep for his own uſe, ſhould be plowed, and his harveſt brought home his Houſe required, his Park pailed, and the like; and for that end he would give to ſundry other of twenty, thirty, forty or fifty Acres; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſervice of plowing a certain quantity, or ſo many dayes of his Lands, and certain Harveſt works, or dayes in the Harveſt to labour, or to repair the Houſe, Park, Pail, or otherwiſe; or to give him for his proviſion, Capons, Hens, Pepper, Commin, Roſes, Gilliflowers, Spurs, Gloves, or the like; or to pay him a certain Rent, and to be ſworn to be his faithful Tenant, which Tenure was called a Soccage Tenure, and is ſo to this day; howbeit, moſt of the plowing, and Harveſt ſervices are turned into Money Rents: the Tenants in Soccage at the Death of every Tenant, were to pay Relief, which was not as Knights Service is, five pound a Knights Fee; but it was and is ſtill one years Rent of the Land, and no Wardſhip or other profit to the Lord. The remainder of the two thouſand Acres he kept to himſelf, whith he uſed to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure by his Bondman, and appointed them at the Courts of his Mannor how they ſhould hold it, making an Entry of it into the Roll of the Remembrances of the Acts of his Court; yet ſtill in the Lords power to take it away, and therefore they were called
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103337:27"/>Tenants at Will, by Copy of Court Roll; being in truth Bondmen at the beginning; but having obtained freedome of their perſons, and gained a cuſtome by uſe of occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying their Lands, they now are called Copyholders, and are ſo priviledged, that the Lord cannot put them out, and all through cuſtome; ſome Copyholders are for Lives, one, two, or three, ſucceſſively; and ſome Inheritances, from Heir to Heir, by cuſtome, and Cuſtome ruleth theſe Eſtates wholly, both for Widows Eſtates, Fines, Harriots, Forfeitures, and all other things. Mannors being in this ſort made at the firſt, reaſon was that the Lord of the Mannor ſhould hold a Court, which is no more then to aſſemble his Tenants together, at a time by him to be appointed; in which Court he was to be informed, by oath of his Tenants, of all ſuch Duties, Rents, Reliefs, and Wardſhips, Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds or the like, that had happned unto him; which information is called a Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then his Bailiff to Seiſe and Diſtrain for thoſe Duties, if they were denied or with-holden, which is called a Court Baron; and herein a man may Sue for any Debt or Treſpaſs under Forty pound value, and the Freeholders are to judge of the Cauſe up on proof produced upon both fides; and therefore the Freeholders of theſe Mannors, as incident to their Tenures, do hold by Suite of Court, which is to come to the Court, and there to judge between no party and party in thoſe perty Actions; And alſo to inform the Lord of Duties, Rents, and Services unpaid to him from his Tenants: By this courſe it is diſcerned, who be the Lords of Lands, ſuch as if the Tenants die without Heir, or be attainted of Felony or Treaſon, ſhall have the Land by Eſcheat.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed, to trace out the ſeveral Pariſhes of <hi>Kent,</hi> and marſhal them Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betically; yet in this Scrutiny, I have not tortured their Names, untill by a nice and curious Anatomie, they confeſſed themſelves to be either of Britiſh, Roman or Saxon Extraction; becauſe, at once to decline, and unravel this Difficulty, I have caſt them into a peculiar Regiſter by themſelves, which ſhall ſtand as an Appendage to the Book, and firſt therefore, to go on, I begin with <hi>Acris.</hi>

                  <hi>ACris</hi> is a ſmall Pariſh lying in the Hundreds of <hi>Folkston</hi> and <hi>Lovingborough,</hi> and was held in the twentieth of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour by <hi>Anketellus de Roſſe;</hi> from which Name it paſſed away by Grant to the <hi>Coſentons</hi> of <hi>Coſenton</hi> in <hi>Alresford,</hi> to hold of the Barony of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> and of his Mannor of <hi>Horton</hi> near <hi>Ferningham:</hi> This Seat being thus annexed to the Demeaſn of this Family, came down to <hi>William de Coſington,</hi> who is in the Liſt of thoſe Kentiſh Gentlemen whom K. <hi>John</hi> in the eighteenth year of his Reign by pardon abſolved, for having taken an Oath to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Dolphin</hi> of <hi>France; Charles</hi> King of <hi>Navarre</hi> (as the private Evidences of <hi>Coſington</hi> inform me) in the year of <hi>Grace</hi> 1366. ſetled an annual Penſion of a thouſand Crowns on Sir <hi>Stephen de Coſington,</hi> and Sir <hi>William</hi> his Son, for their remarkable Service performed againſt the Enemies of his Crown and Scepter. The laſt of this Family, which held this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, was Sir <hi>J.

                  <hi>Addington</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Larkfield,</hi> was as high as any Track of Evidence can tranſport me to diſcover, the Inheritance of a noble Family called <hi>Mandeville,</hi> and divers Deeds of a very venerable Antiquity, being without date, and now in the hands of Mr. <hi>Watton,</hi> do atteſt <hi>Roger de Mandeville</hi> in thoſe elder Times to have been Lord of the Fee; but before the end of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, this Family was vaniſhed, and had ſurrendred the poſſeſſion of this place to <hi>Robert At Checquer,</hi> in whom the poſſeſſion was but of a narrow Date, for hee not long after alienated his Intereſt in it to <hi>Nicholas Dagworth,</hi> as is evident by this Record regiſtred in the Book of <hi>Aid</hi> kept in the <hi>Exchequer, De Nicholao de Dagworth pro uno Feodo Militis, quod Roberius de Scaccario. tenuit in Addington de Warreno de Montecaniſio</hi> 40. s. That is, <hi>Nicholas Dagworth</hi> in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, paid a reſpective Supply of 40. s. for his Mannor of <hi>Addington,</hi> which both he and <hi>Robert At Checquer,</hi> which enjoyed it before him, held of the Honour of <hi>Swanſcamp Caſtle,</hi> as being the capital Seat of the Barony of <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenſey,</hi> under the Notion of a whole Knights Fee. But in this Family the Title was a Volatile as in the former, for before the going out of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, I find it paſſed away from <hi>Dagworth</hi> to Sir <hi>Hugh Segrave,</hi> and he in the ſeventh year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, alienated it to <hi>Richard Charles,</hi> deſcended from <hi>Edward Charles</hi> Captain and Admirall of the Seas, from the <hi>Thames</hi> mouth Northward, in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, as appears <hi>Pat.</hi> 34. <hi>Edwardi primi.</hi> But he was ſcarce warm in his new Acquiſts, but he expired in two Daughters and Coheirs, <hi>Alice</hi> matched to <hi>William Snaith,</hi> and <hi>Joan</hi> married to <hi>Richard Ormeskirk;</hi> but this Mannor upon the Diſtinction of the Eſtate into Parcells was entwin'd with the Demeaſne of <hi>Snaith,</hi> and he dyed poſſeſt of it (as the date of his Tombe in <hi>Addington</hi> Church informs me) in the year 1409. but dyed without Iſſue-male, ſo that his ſole Daughter and Heir being wedded to <hi>Watton</hi> made it the Inheritance of that Family, and here have they planted themſelves ever ſince that Alliance, and have performed many ſignal Services to this County by being inveſted with places of Truſt, as Juſtices of the Peace, Commiſſioners of the Sewers, and other Officers of the like Condition, which hath much inforced and multiplied the eminent Reputation of this ancient Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allington</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Lark field</hi> is eminent for an ancient Caſtle within the Limits of it; which, as Mr. <hi>Darrell</hi> and Mr. <hi>Merſh</hi> do aſſert, was erected by <hi>William de Columbariis,</hi> or <hi>Columbers;</hi> and this Mr. <hi>Darrell,</hi> who was very curious in Diſquiſitions of this Nature, more poſſitively affirms, becauſe in the eighth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, when (as appears by the Records of the Tower) there was an exact Survey taken of all the Caſtles of <hi>England,</hi> and of thoſe who were either Proprietaries of them, or elſe the reſpective Caſtellans or Guardians, one of the above mentioned Family was found to be poſſeſſor of this Fortreſſe, and was alſo Lord of the Mannor, which was ſtill annexed to the Caſtle; but this Name was of no long continuance in the Tenure of either, for about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, they came to own the Signorie of Sir <hi>Stephen de Pencheſter,</hi> Lord Warden afterwards of the Cinque Ports, to whom and to <hi>Margaret</hi> his Wife, Daughter of the famous <hi>Hubert de Burgh</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt granted a Licence in the ninth year of his Reign, as appears by the Patent-Rolls of that Time to erect a Caſtle, and to fortifie and embattle at <hi>Allington;</hi> ſo that it ſeems it was only before <hi>Fortalitium,</hi> ſome ſmall Fortreſſe, and could not be marſhall'd under the juſt Notion of a Caſtle, untill it had received new Symetrie and Dimenſions, by thoſe Appendages and Supplements which were added to it by this great Man; and having thus eſtabliſhed this Pile, it came to own his Name, and is in ſome old Records called <hi>Allington Pencheſter,</hi> and not undeſervedly; for in the eighth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, he obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <hi>Allington,</hi> and alſo a Market Weekly on the Tueſday, and a Fair yearly three days, on the <hi>Vigil,</hi> the day, and day after St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> but deceaſed without Iſſue Male; ſo that after his <hi>Exit,</hi> it came to acknowledge <hi>Stephen de Cobham,</hi> who had married his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Coheir, and he inocculated his own Name upon it, and called it <hi>Allington Cobham,</hi> which flouriſhed ſeverall Deſcents in this Family, untill the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and then I find it in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Brent,</hi> but remained not long in this Name; for in the eighth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, <hi>John Brent</hi> paſſed away the Caſtle and Mannor of <hi>Allington</hi> to Sir <hi>Henry Wiat</hi> one of the Privie Councel to that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103337:28"/>Prince, but his infortunate Grandchild Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat,</hi> having by his Defection in the ſecond year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> forfeited it to the Crown, it remained there untill Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> granted it to <hi>Jo. Aſtley</hi> Esq; Maſter of her Jewels, whoſe Son Sir <hi>Jo. Aſtley</hi> dying without Iſſue, it came by Deſcent to Sir <hi>Jacob Aſtley,</hi> created Lord <hi>Aſtley</hi> by the late King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> whoſe Deſcendant does now enjoy the Poſſeſſion of it.</p>

                  <hi>Malmains</hi> by vulgar Corruption of the word called <hi>Smalmains,</hi> with <hi>Hollmeade,</hi> which was ever accounted an Appendage to it, are firſt to be conſidered. In the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third I find <hi>Thomas de Malmains</hi> Son of <hi>Nicholas de Malmains,</hi> (who was Poſſeſſor of both theſe Places in Times of an elder Computation,) paid reſpective Aid at making the black Prince Knight for his Lands at <hi>Alkham.</hi> But after this I find no more intelligence given me by Record of this Family, for about the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth I diſcover <hi>Iohn Alkham</hi> (who extracted his Sirname from this Pariſh, and it is very probable had here his Manſion, though now it have found a double Sepulcher, that of Oblivion, and its own Rubbiſh) to have been poſſeſt of them both, which he held in <hi>Caſtle-Guard</hi> Tenure of <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle, and paid a ſubſidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Supply for them in the fourth year of that Prince, at the Marriage of <hi>Blanch</hi> his Daughter; from which temporary Aſſeſſement or Contribution, ſeverall Parcels of Land in this County have ever ſince contracted the Name of <hi>Blanch-Lands.</hi> In <hi>Alkham</hi> the Signorie of both Places did reſide, untill the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and then they were demiſed by <hi>Peter Alkham</hi> to <hi>Iohn Warren</hi> Gentleman; in which Name after they had continued untill the latter End of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, <hi>Malmains</hi> was paſſed away to <hi>Brown,</hi> who in our Memory conveyed it by Sale to <hi>Luſhinton;</hi> and <hi>Hollmeade</hi> was by the ſame Viciſſitude annexed to the Demeaſn of <hi>Wollet,</hi> a Name that is grown reverend by an Efflux of many Ages both here and at <hi>Elham.</hi>

               <p>The Mannor of <hi>Hoptons,</hi> another place conſiderable in <hi>Alkham.</hi> If you will ſearch who was in elder Times poſſeſt of it, the private date, leſſe Deeds will inform you, that anciently it was the Inheritance of <hi>Peter de Hall,</hi> but was not long perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the poſſeſſion of this Name, for in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, (as appears by the Book of Aid) it was the Inheritance of <hi>William de Bourn;</hi> and here it ſeems the Title was more conſtant, for in this Family it was reſident untill the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then it was alienated to <hi>Baker</hi> of <hi>Caldham,</hi> in whom it had not long continued, but by his Daughter and Coheir it became the Inheritance of <hi>Robert Brandred,</hi> from which Name about the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth it paſſed away by Sale to <hi>Brown</hi> of <hi>Bechworth Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and here it fixed, untill that Age which came within the Verge of our Grandfathers Remembrance, and then it was demiſed to <hi>Godman,</hi> in whoſe Deſcendants the Propriety now continues.</p>

                  <hi>Evering</hi> is the laſt place of Account in <hi>Alkham,</hi> it was the poſſeſſion of a Family ſo called which branched from the ancient Lords of <hi>Folkston,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Averenches,</hi> whoſe Armes were (as is manifeſt by ancient Armorials) <hi>Or</hi> five <hi>Cheverons Gules,</hi> and theſe <hi>Everings,</hi> bare <hi>Or</hi> five <hi>Cheverons Azure. Wolwardus de Evering</hi> held it under the Notion and by the Service of a whole Knights Fee, in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, of the Lords of <hi>Folkston.</hi> And by a ſucceſſive Chanell of many Deſcents hath the Title flowed ſo conſtantly in this Family, that this Seat is at this inſtant annexed to their Inheritance.</p>

                  <hi>Hornes place</hi> in this Pariſh was the Seat for many hundreds of years of Gentlemen of that Sirname. <hi>William Horne</hi> was one of the Conſervators of the <hi>Peace</hi> in the firſt year of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second for this County, and <hi>Michael Horne</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> in the ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and held his Shrievalty at <hi>Apledore,</hi> and from him did the proprietie of this place deſcend to <hi>Anne Horne</hi> the laſt of this Name, who matched with <hi>Benedict Guldford</hi> Eſquire, who in her Right, as being the ſole Inheritrix of this place, became Lord of this Seat, but he denying the Oath of Supremacy, which began about the twelfth and thirteenth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to be tendered to Romiſh Recuſants, and ſheltring himſelfe by a Receſſe and Flight into forrein Parts, fell under the diſpleaſure of the Queen, and his Eſtate under the Fury of a <hi>praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire;</hi> ſo that this Mannor was torne away from his Intereſt by a Confiſcation of it to the Crown, and ſhortly after the above mentioned Princeſſe granted it to her faithfull Servant <hi>George Chowte</hi> Eſquire, from whom it is now deſcended to his great Grandchild Mr. <hi>Edward Chowt</hi>

                  <hi>Dean Court</hi> in this Pariſh was the Manſion of a Family who borrowed their Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name from this Town, and were called <hi>Apledore,</hi> and ſealed with a Pile ſurmounted with a Feſſe, which was their paternal Coat, but before the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, this Family found its Sepulcher in a Female Heir, for <hi>Thomas de Apledore,</hi> dying witout Iſſue, <hi>Elnith</hi> his only Siſter entituled her husband <hi>William Roper</hi> to his Eſtate here, and in the confining Marſh; and by an uninterrupted Right derived from this Alliance, hath the title of this place been ſupported in the Family of <hi>Roper,</hi> for ſo many Deſcents, that it is now at laſt devolved to the right honorable <hi>Chriſtopher Roper</hi> Baron of <hi>Tenham,</hi> in whom it is at this inſtant reſident.</p>
               <p>There was a Caſtle anciently here at <hi>Apledore,</hi> which when the <hi>Danes</hi> in the reign of <hi>Etheldred</hi> Father of <hi>Edmund Ironſide,</hi> made this County the Scene of their Devaſtations, was mingled by the flame they put it into, in the year 892. in its own Rubbiſh, yet like a <hi>Phaenix,</hi> it roſe into new ſhape and frame again, out of its Aſhes, and continued in the Regiſter and under the notion of the Caſtles and Fortreſſes of this County, until the year, 1380. and then (as <hi>How</hi> relates in his Chronicle, who likewiſe repreſents the former Tragedie,) the <hi>French</hi> making an hoſtile Eruption on this part of the County, made it once more a pitied and calamitous heap of flame and ruine; out of whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled reliques (the Church now viſible was not only repaired, but as ſome from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Tradition affirm, wholly reedified; a probable Argument of the ancient Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, Magnificence and Strength of this now totally-demoliſhed Fortreſſe.</p>
               <p>I had almoſt omitted the Mannor of <hi>Frenchay,</hi> which likewiſe lies within the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Apledore,</hi> and had in elder Times, as appears by old evidences, Owners of that Sirname; but the greateſt Glory that it atchieved, was, that ever ſince the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, untill the Government of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, it acknowledged the Family of <hi>Haut</hi> for its Proprietaries, the laſt of which was Sir <hi>William Haut,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in two Daughters and Coheirs, whereof <hi>Joan</hi> the youngeſt matched to Sir

                  <hi>Thomas Wiat,</hi> ſhared his eſtate at this place, but he being attainted in the ſecond year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> this was confiſcated to the Crown, and lay there untill the twenty fourth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then it was granted back to <hi>George Wiat</hi> Eſquite, whoſe Son Sir <hi>Francis Wiat,</hi> not many years ſince, paſſed it away to <hi>Thomas Floyd</hi> of <hi>Gore-court</hi> in <hi>Otham</hi> Eſquire, and he in the year 1636 alienated it to Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> of <hi>Tunſtall</hi> Knight Baronet, whoſe Grandchild Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> is now in poſſeſſion of it.</p>

                  <hi>Apledore</hi> had anciently a Market to be obſerved here weekly, granted to it, by <hi>Edward</hi> the third in the thirty ſecond year of his reign, which ſince is vaniſhed into Diſuſe by Intermiſſion.</p>

The <hi>Auſtins</hi> for ſome Hundreds of years have been Tenants for this and the Mannor of <hi>Godmerſham</hi> to the Church, as if to improve and gratifie the Memory of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> their firſt Abbot the Monks of <hi>Chriſt Church</hi> were determined to plant ſome of their Patrimony in that Name, though perhaps but of accidental Coincidence.</p>

                  <hi>Aldington</hi> is the next place to be remembred in the Hundred of <hi>Street,</hi> and <hi>Bircholt Franchiſe</hi> more eminent, becauſe here are choſen the Officers yearly relating to the Mannors of <hi>Romney Merſh.</hi> Queen <hi>Edgiva</hi> mother to King <hi>Edmund,</hi> and King <hi>Edred</hi> gave this Town to <hi>Chriſt Church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in Groſſe with other Lands <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 961.

But when the Kings of <hi>England</hi> intended to pare off ſomething of the Revenue and Power of the Arch-Biſhops, which was in their Eſtimate of too vaſt and wide an Extent; this Mannor, with many other, was paſſed away by Exchange to the Crown in the twenty ninth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, by <hi>Thomas Cranmer</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>

                  <hi>Ruffins-Hill</hi> in this Pariſh, was the Seat of the <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s ancient Gentlemen, whoſe Eſtate by two Daughters and Coheirs came to the <hi>Clerks</hi> of <hi>Kingſnoth,</hi> and the <hi>Blechen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</hi> But whether deſcended from <hi>Godfrey le Falconer</hi> the Son of <hi>Balder,</hi> unto whom K. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond aſſigned, gave, and granted much Land in theſe Parts, to hold in Serjeantie, by the Service of keeping two Hawks for the King and his Succeſſors, I cannot poſitively ſay.

                  <hi>Ainsford</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Axtane</hi> lieth upon the River of <hi>Darent,</hi> and gave Seat and Sirname to a worthy Family that continued till the Time of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond:

                  <hi>Wingham Barton</hi> is another eminent Mannor in this Pariſh, which belonged to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and when <hi>John Peckham</hi> founded his Colledge at <hi>Wingham</hi> in the year 1282. there was an Exhibition ſetled on that Seminary or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, iſſuing out of this Manuor, from whence it is ſuppoſed by ſome it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the Name of <hi>Wingham Barton;</hi> though I rather conjecture it was called ſo from its Situation, in oppoſition to another of that Name, called <hi>Firmins Barton,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by <hi>Canterbury.</hi> But to proceed, this continued Archiepiſcopal, untill the twenty ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was exchanged by <hi>Thomas</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with the Crown, and reſted there, untill Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> granted it to Sir <hi>Roger Manwood,</hi> whoſe ſon Sir <hi>Peter Manwood</hi> paſſed it away by his Truſtees not many years ſince to Sir <hi>William Curteen</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and he gave it in Dower with his daughter matched to <hi>Henry</hi> late Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> who upon his deceaſe ordered it to be ſold to diſcharge ſome Debts, and was accordingly not long ſince by his Counteſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by Sale to Mr. <hi>James Thurbarne</hi> of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> one of the Cinque Ports, Son of <hi>James Thurbarne</hi> Eſquire, a Juſtice of Peace in this County in the Reign of K. <hi>James,</hi> whoſe Anceſtors from 1331 have continued very eminent in the Cinque Ports, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Haſting</hi> and <hi>Romney,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Romney Merſh,</hi> as appears by divers ancient Records.

                  <hi>Chilton</hi> lies likewiſe in <hi>Aſh,</hi> and claims our Remembrance, becauſe it yielded a Seat, and afforded a Sirname to <hi>William de Chilton,</hi> who held it at his Deceaſe, which was in the thirty firſt year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, <hi>Rot.

And here again the Title was as fickle, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, for in the thirty ſeventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, I find the poſſeſſion was departed from <hi>Baude,</hi> and caſt into the Patrimony of <hi>Thomas Wolton,</hi> who at that Time held it at his Death. <hi>Rot.

But after this Family went out, I find the Inheritance more fixed and permanent, for by divers old Court-Rolls that were taken in the latter End of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, I diſcover <hi>William de Septuans</hi> whoſe ſucceſſors were ſince called <hi>Harfleet,</hi> to be poſſeſt of it, and from him is the Propriety drawn through the ſucceſſive Series of many Deſcents to the <hi>Harfleets</hi> of this Age, who are ſtill entituled to the Signory of it.</p>

                  <hi>Hells</hi> is in the Regiſter alſo of thoſe Mannors which are within the Circle of this Pariſh, and gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of no ſhallow Antiquity in this Tract; <hi>Thomas de Hells</hi> obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Mannor of <hi>Hells</hi> in the eighteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt; <hi>Bertram de Hells</hi> was Lieuetenant of <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, under <hi>Reginald</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Conſtable of <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle: <hi>Gilbert de Hells</hi> of <hi>Hells Court,</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> the thirtieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and in this Name did the Proprietie lodge untill the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and then it was by ſale tranſplanted into <hi>Wroth;</hi> and the Title there ſetled untill the latter End of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and then it was by the ſame Viciſſitude carried off to <hi>Peake,</hi> where the inſtant Inheritance is reſident.</p>

                  <hi>Fleet</hi> is the laſt Mannor in <hi>Aſh,</hi> which is ennobled by having as (high as any Track of Record can guide us to a Diſcovery) the Earls of <hi>Oxford</hi> for Proprietaries; <hi>Hugh de Vere</hi>

And certainly from this place, did the <hi>Stone-houſes</hi> both of <hi>Kent, Berkſhire,</hi> and <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> either as Tenants to the <hi>Monks</hi> of the aboveſaid Cloiſter, or elſe as having ſome Manſion, or Habitation of theirs, ſituated no far diſtance from this Mannor, anciently extract and ſpin out the primitive Original of their Name and Family: This is my conjecture, which I leave to more ſober and ſeverer Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings either to embrace, or elſe abandon and diſcard.</p>

                  <hi>Brabourne</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Bircholt Franchiſes,</hi> was a Record drawn out of an old Manuſcript, does engage me to affirm the Inheritance in Times of a very ancient Date of a Lady called <hi>Salburga</hi> the Words of the Record that ſtrengthen this Aſſertion are theſe; <hi>Provaeda Matrona Nomine Salburga Domina de Brabourne Teſtamentum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitit, ut qui tenerent Brabourne darent annuatim Sancto Auguſtino</hi> 40 <hi>Ambras Braſii,</hi> (that is, Plates of Braſs) 4 <hi>Boves,</hi> 15 <hi>Arietes,</hi> 20 <hi>Panes,</hi> 1 <hi>Piſſ.

In Times of a lower Deſcent, I find <hi>Alexander de Strabolgie</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> who flouriſhed here in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, to have held it, and from him did it devolve to his great Grandchild, <hi>David de Strabolgie</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> who held it at his Death, which was in the thirtieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc.

Eſc. Num.</hi> 31. and by a Right derived from her did <hi>John Halſham</hi> poſſeſs it at his Deceaſe, which was in the ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, <hi>Rot. Eſc.

Lewknor,</hi> and <hi>Ioan</hi> his Wife in the fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Iohn Scott</hi> Comptroller of the Houſe to K. <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and from this Sir <hi>Iohn Scott</hi> is Mr. <hi>Edward Scott</hi> Eſquire, by an uninterrupted Chanell of an Original un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtioned Deſcent extracted, who is at this inſtant, by a Right tranſplanted unto him from many illuſtrious Predeceſſors, entituled to the Poſſeſſion of this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bircholt</hi> in this Pariſh, is made more eminent in this Account, becauſe it affords a Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is ſituated; by Deeds of a very reverend and venerable Aſpect, which by the obſolete and antiquated Character ſeem to have been written in the Time of K. <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the third, it is made the Inheritance ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally of a Family called <hi>Bircholt; Stephen de Bircholt</hi> poſſeſſor of this Mannor paid reſpective Aid for it (as appears by the Book of <hi>Aid</hi>) at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. But after the Reign
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103337:42"/>of this Prince, I do not find long permanent in this Family, for in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, ſeveral old Court Rolls diſcover to me one <hi>Richard Halk</hi> or <hi>Hawke</hi> of <hi>Weſthawks</hi> in <hi>Kingſnoth,</hi> to be planted in the Poſſeſſion, and an old <hi>Arbor Radicalis</hi> or Tree from whence branches out the ſeveral Deſcents of <hi>Hawk</hi> or <hi>Halke,</hi> and which is now preſerved amongſt the Evidences of <hi>Bircholt</hi> Houſe; this Family is made to have been Proprietaries of this Mannor ever ſince the Beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, nor is yet departed from the Name, but remains at this inſtant knit to the reſt of the Demeaſn of this ancient Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heminge</hi> is the laſt place of account in <hi>Brabourne,</hi> which anciently yielded both Seat and Sirname to a Family of that Appellation; I ſhall not need to make a Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation from Deeds without Date, of the Antiquity of this Family at this place, it is enough that I ſhall inform the Reader that after it had been the Poſſeſſion of this Name (as may be traced out by Evidences) almoſt three hundred years, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by <hi>William Heminge</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth to <hi>Peter Nott,</hi> in which Name the Title is now reſident.</p>

                  <hi>Benenden</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Cranbrooke</hi> was, as <hi>Doomeſday</hi> Book informs me, if not all yet for a principal part of it poſſeſt by one <hi>Godricus</hi> or <hi>Godric. In Benenden manſit Godricus</hi> (ſays the Record) <hi>&amp; tenet XX. Acras in Alodio ſuo.</hi> What this <hi>Alodium</hi> was, the <hi>Civilians,</hi> and out of them Sir <hi>Henry Spilman</hi> in his Gloſſarie will inform you. <hi>Alodium eſt praedium liberum</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>nulli Servituti obnoxium, quod opponitur Feudo, nam olim Feuda non poſſent vendi ſine conſenſu Domini. At Alodium vero eſt. quod per omnem haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſeriem diſcurrit, &amp; cuivis è populo (etiam reclamante Domino) dare poſſit aut venundari.</hi> The reſult of all which is this, that the word <hi>Alodium</hi> ſignifies a Free Inheritance or Patrimony, not chained up to any particular Service whatſoever, which hath the leaſt Reſemblace or ſymtome of ſervitude, either by Cuſtome, Preſcription, or Law imprinted upon it, and may in <hi>Engliſh</hi> be ſtyled Free Soccage, and which being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and conducted along by an uninterrupted Series of Deſcent from Poſterity to Poſterity, might be pawned, mortgaged or alienated to any Perſon whatſoever; whereas on the contrary, Lands which were Feudal could not be paſſed away without the Lords conſent: And this agrees with the Municipal Laws of <hi>France,</hi> which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſtyled thoſe Perſons whoſe Lands were fortified with that Tenure, <hi>Leuds Francs, id eſt, Nobiles nullius Domini Imperio evocati, Homines ſui Juris, &amp; non Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalis, id eſt, nullo Feudi Gravamine coerciti vel reſtricti;</hi> that is, Men of a noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, free and unreſtrained, whoſe Demeaſns were not manacled and tyed up with the Obligations of any Tenure which was Servile, as thoſe whoſe Lands were Fendal: But enough of this, I ſhall now return to <hi>Benenden,</hi> which as it gave Seat to the above mentioned <hi>Godricus,</hi> ſo it ſeems his Deſcendants extracted there Sirname from thence, and aſſumed the Denomination of <hi>Benenden,</hi> and bare for their Armes in a Shield <hi>Azure</hi> a <hi>Lobſter Or,</hi> and certainly were of Account in this Track, for <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Roger de Benenden,</hi> held a Knights Fee in <hi>Benenden</hi> in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third: But as all Families are chained up to a fixed Period, (like the Sea which is it ſelf bound in with a Girdle of Sand) ſo had this its concluſion likewiſe, for <hi>Joan Benenden</hi> the Heir General of this Name, by matching with Sir <hi>William Brenchley</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas, faſtned this Mannor to his Inheritance, and they both lie buried in <hi>Chriſt Church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> He died, as the Date upon their Tomb, for they ſlumber under one Marble, inſorms me, in the year 1446, and She in the year 1453. But after his Deceaſe the Title of this place, did quickly acknowledge another Proprietary, for the Heir General of this Family matched to <hi>More</hi> of <hi>More Court</hi> in <hi>Ivy-Church,</hi> where having been many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they diſlodged from ſo ſolitary an Habitation, and planted themſelves at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenden,</hi> where they erected a Houſe and adopted it into their own Name, by ſtyling it <hi>More Court,</hi> but though it ſtill ſtand an Alphabet to the Memory of this Family by bearing their Sirname, yet did it not many years after its firſt Inſtitution and Frame acknowledge the Signory of this Family, for <hi>John More</hi> Eſquire, in the firſt year of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> conveyed it to Mr. <hi>William Watts,</hi> from whom by ſucceſſive Right it is now come down to Mr. ......... <hi>Watts,</hi> and owns him for its preſent Proprietary.</p>
               <p>The Mannor of <hi>Hempſted</hi> in this Pariſh, anciently, that is, about the twentieth year
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103337:42"/>of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, belonged, as appears by the Book in the Exchequer, called <hi>Teſta de Nevil,</hi> to <hi>Robert de Hempſted,</hi> from whence he aſſumed his Sirname, which could not make the Title long liv'd in his Family; for about the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, I find it paſſed away to <hi>Echingham</hi> of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and <hi>James de Echingham</hi> held it by the fourth part of a Knights Fee, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight; but after this the Title was not long conſtant to the Intereſt of this Family; for about the Beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, I find it in the Hands of Sir <hi>Robert Belknap</hi> the Judge, who being attainted in the tenth year of that Prince, by the Malice and crooked Arts of a factious and inſolent Nobility, there was Survey taken of his Eſtate in the fourteenth year of his Reign, and then this Mannor with the reſidue of his Eſtate eſcheated, being annexed to the Crown, it was by <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond granted to <hi>William de Guldford</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the eleventh year of that Prince, deſcended from <hi>Henry de Guldford,</hi> a great Benefactor to the Priory of <hi>Taning,</hi> in the twenty eighth year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the firſt, and who is mentioned in the Book of <hi>Aid</hi> to have held the Mannor of <hi>Wickham</hi> near <hi>Lidde</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> by Knights Service, in the twentyeth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; and the aboveſaid <hi>William</hi> having thus by the Favour of his Prince obtained this Mannor, made it his Seat, and tranſmitted it to his Succeſſors, who much improved it with the Supplement of Additional Buildings, ſo that it hath not only formerly for many Generations continued to be the Seat of this Familie, but is likewiſe a Manſion relating to this Name at this inſtant.</p>
               <p>Great <hi>Maytham</hi> in <hi>Benenden</hi> was a Mannor which related to the Proprietie of the noble Family of <hi>Malmains,</hi> whoſe principal Seat was at <hi>Malmains</hi> in <hi>Stoke,</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Hoo; Nicholas Malmain</hi> Grandchild of <hi>John Malmain</hi> who likewiſe held this Mannor in the twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, paid a proportionate ſupply for <hi>Maytham</hi> at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, and died poſſeſt of it in the twenty third year of that Prince: But after this it was not long permanent in this Name, for in the fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Nicholas Carew</hi> held it at the Marriage of <hi>Blanch</hi> that Princes Daughter, and in his Family was the Title conſtant untill the latter End of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was paſſed away to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> afterwards created Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who being convicted of High Treaſon in the thirty ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, it eſcheated to the Crown, and that Prince in the thirty third year of his Rule granted it to Sir <hi>Thomas Wiatt,</hi> who the ſame year conveyed it by Sale to Sir <hi>Walter Henley</hi> of <hi>Courſehorne,</hi> the Kings Serjeant at Law, and he not long after diſpoſed of it to <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> of <hi>Bedgbury</hi> Eſquire, who had wedded <hi>Hellen</hi> one of his three Daughters and Coheirs, and he in the laſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth alienated ſome part of the Land which related to it to <hi>Richard Parker</hi> and <hi>Anthony Franklin,</hi> but the Mannor it ſelf reſted in <hi>Colepeper</hi> of <hi>Bedgebury,</hi> untill the late King granted it away not many years ſince to Alderman <hi>Wright</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as being forfeited to the Crowne, becauſe the Lord of it did not pay thoſe Scots and Aſſeſſements which were laid upon him towards the Reparation of the Banks of the Merſh; and by <hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter and Coheir of the aboveſaid Alderman, is it now become the Inheritence of Mr. <hi>Richard Cordall</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lowden</hi> or little <hi>Maytham</hi> is the laſt Mannor in this Pariſh, and was wrapped up in that wide Eſtate which in this County claimed the Family of <hi>Atteleeze</hi> for Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, Sir <hi>Richard Attleeze</hi> held four Knights in <hi>Rolvenden</hi> and <hi>Benenden</hi> in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, whereof this was parcell, but he dying without Iſſue in the year 1394, as is manifeſt by the Date on his Tomb in <hi>Shelwich</hi> Church, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus Attleeze</hi> his Brother became the Heir to his Eſtate, but this Mannor was not long after reſident in this Name, for in the fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, which happened about the year 1403, (as appears by the Record kept in the Exchequer, called the Roll of <hi>Blanch</hi>-Lands) it was poſſeſt by <hi>Thomas Aucher,</hi> and he paid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Aid for it at the Marriage of <hi>Blanch</hi> that Princes Daughter, and from him did it devolve by Deſcent to his Grandchild <hi>John Aucher</hi> of <hi>Loſenham</hi> Eſquire, who concluded in <hi>Ann Aucher</hi> his ſole Heir, who was matched to <hi>William Colepeper</hi> ſecond Son of Sir <hi>John Colepeper</hi> of <hi>Bedgebury,</hi> and ſo this Mannor with much other Land came to own the Dominion of that Name, and remained annexed to that Family

                  <hi>Bokinfold</hi> in this Pariſh is an eminent Mannor which belonged to that Chauntry and Chappel which was founded here by <hi>Hamon de Crevequer</hi> (and confirmed as appears by the firſt Book of <hi>Compoſitions,</hi> kept amongſt the Records of the Church of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi>) with the Demeaſne appertaining to it, in the forty firſt year of <hi>Ed.</hi> the third, and continued being thus forſeited and ſecured by the Royal Charter, untouched, untill the generall Suppreſſion; and being diſſolved, the Revenue which anciently ſupported it, was in the thirty firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, carried of by Grant to <hi>Paul Sidnor</hi> Eſquire, who not long after paſſed it away to Sir <hi>John Gates,</hi> to whom it was again confirmed in the firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth; but he being infortunately attainted in the fourth year of the aboveſaid Prince, as being one of the Partiſans of the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> to whoſe Service, and for whoſe Cauſe he ſacrificed his Head, this returned to the Crown, and dwelt in its Revenue untill Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> granted it away again to <hi>Katharine Tong,</hi> who ſuddenly after alienated her Intereſt in it to <hi>Revell,</hi> and he about the latter End of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> paſſed it away to <hi>Colepeper,</hi> from whom in our Fathers Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory it went away to <hi>Dyke,</hi> and very ſuddenly from him again to Mr. <hi>Benedict Barnham,</hi> by one of whoſe four Daughters and Coheirs it came to be the Patrimony of <hi>Soam,</hi> who lately hath demiſed his whole Concernment in it to Mr. <hi>George Brown</hi> formerly of <hi>Spelmonden</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> now of <hi>Buckland</hi> in <hi>Surrey.</hi>

               <p>There was formerly a Park at this Place, for in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Bartholomew de Badeleſmer</hi> held the Mannor and Park of <hi>Bockinfold</hi> in Fee, by

                  <hi>Parrocks</hi> in this Pariſh was anciently a Mannor relating to a Family of that Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which continued Lords of the Fee untill the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and then it was by Sale conveyed to <hi>William Hextall</hi> Eſquire, who dying without Iſſue male, <hi>Margaret</hi> his ſole Daughter and Heir brought this and much Land beſide to be the Inheritance of <hi>William Whetenhall</hi> Eſquire, from whom the right of Deſcent wafted it down to his Succeſſor Sir <hi>Richard Whetenhall,</hi> who in the twelfth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> demiſed it to <hi>William Brooke</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> who not long after paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Thomas Nevill</hi> Grandfather to the right honorable <hi>Mildmay</hi> Earl of <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> now Poſſeſſor of it.</p>

                  <hi>Maſcals, Capgrove</hi> or <hi>Capgrave,</hi> and <hi>Chekeſwell,</hi> are three Mannors in <hi>Brenchley</hi> alſo, which as the Book of <hi>Aid</hi> informs me, were in the tweneieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, in the poſſeſſion of <hi>John de Capgrave,</hi> and it is probable that <hi>John Capgrave</hi> an eminent Monk, an Ornament to Learning, and to the Priory of <hi>Chriſt Church,</hi> who flouriſhed in the year 1484, and is mentioned with ſo much Honour by <hi>Pitſeus,</hi> was deſcended from this man, in whoſe Name theſe Mannors were not after this long permanent, for as the learned and laborious <hi>Sidrach Petit</hi> does informe me in his Inqueſt of <hi>Kent,</hi> they fell in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, under the Signory of <hi>Vaux,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth alienated his Propriety in them to <hi>Humphrey Stafford</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whoſe infortunate Grandchild <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> being attainted in the twelfth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, theſe with the Reſidue of his Eſtate eſcheated to the Crown; from which not many years after, they were paſſed away to <hi>Edward Ferrers</hi> Eſquire, and he conveyed his Right to <hi>Whetonhall,</hi> who about the beginning of King <hi>James</hi> demiſed them to <hi>Ouldſworth,</hi> who not long after ſold them to <hi>Bartue,</hi> and he almoſt in our Memory tranſmitted them by Sale to Mr. <hi>Cha.

               <p>The Rectory of <hi>Brenchley</hi> was given by <hi>Richard de Clare</hi> to the Canons of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and compounded with the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> with this Proviſion reſerved, that the Rector for the Time being ſhould pay two wax Tapers of four pound Weight to the Priory of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> at the Feaſt of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> The Mannor which was annexed to this Rectory, was upon the Diſſolution of this Cloiſter in the thirty firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth granted to <hi>Paul Sidnor,</hi> and he not long after paſſed it away to <hi>William Waller</hi> Eſquire, from which Family not many years ſince it was by Purchaſe inveſted in the Family of <hi>Courthop.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Moatlands</hi> was the Inheritance of a Family who extracted their Sirname from hence, and were called <hi>Brenchley,</hi> a Branch of which was Sir <hi>William Brenchley</hi> Lord Cheif Juſtice of the Common Pleas, who founded a Chauntry or Chappel in the Navy of the Cathedral at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and dyed in the year 1446 without Iſſue; nor did theſe Lands continue much longer in the Name, for in the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth I find them in the Tenure of <hi>More,</hi> who had matched with the Heir Generall, and here the Propriety of this place remained interwoven, with the Inheritance of this Family untill that Age which fell under our Fathers Remembrance, and then it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103337:44"/>was tranſplanted by Sale into <hi>Roberts,</hi> the Family with now poſſeſſes it.</p>
               <p>There are two other Seats in this Pariſh, which may deſerve our notice; the firſt is <hi>Cats-Place,</hi> which gave Seat to <hi>Hugh de Cat,</hi> and in Recompence took its Denomination from him, and after the Title of it had lodged in this Name many Deſcents, even until the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, it was paſſed away to <hi>Tilden,</hi> of <hi>Tildens Place</hi> in <hi>Marden;</hi> and after the Poſſeſſion had ſome Ages been united to their Intereſt, it was ſome few years ſince unfaſtned, and the Propriety of it carried over to <hi>Baſſage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is <hi>Vanes,</hi> which yielded both Seat and Sirname to as Illuſtrious a Family as any in this Track, <hi>Robert Vane</hi> or <hi>Fane</hi> (for they are proimiſcuouſly ſo written in ancient Rolls) paid reſpective Aid for it, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and is from him by a continued Series ſtill tranſported along in the Demeaſn of this Name and Family; ſo that here (if my Light fail me not) ſhould I look for the original of that Noble Name and Family, that ſince hath ſo fairly ſpread into ſo many ſeveral Branches iſſued primitively from this firſt original Stem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bredgar</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Milton,</hi> hath ſeveral places in it obſervable; The firſt is <hi>Bexon,</hi> from whence the Borough of <hi>Bexon</hi> or <hi>Bexon Street</hi> derives it ſelf; It gave Sirname to a Family in whom in clder Times the Inheritance was planted, and there is yet extant in the Church Windows in coloured Glaſs a ſuperannuated Portraicture mangled by rude hands, and demoliſhed almoſt by the Injuries of Time, with this Inſcription affixed to the pedeſtal, <hi>Orate pro Anima Joannes de Bexon,</hi> which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to us whoſe Effigies is repreſented by it; this <hi>Iohn Bexon</hi> flouriſhed in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, as appears by Deeds, and <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and had Iſſue <hi>Iohn Bexon</hi> likewiſe Rroprietary of this place, after whom I can track no more of the Family at <hi>Bredgar:</hi> In the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, I find it inveſted in <hi>Tong,</hi> who it is probable were extracted originally from <hi>Tong,</hi> not far diſtant, a Family of good eſtimate in this County, for I find by ſome old Deeds, that <hi>Semanus de Tong</hi> who in the ſixteenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, was Tenant to the <hi>Maiſon le Dieu in Oſpringe,</hi> for Lands at <hi>Lurdinden</hi> in <hi>Challock,</hi> ſealed with a <hi>Bend cotiſed</hi> between ſix <hi>Martletts,</hi> and ſometimes with the <hi>Bend uncotiſed,</hi> and from him are the <hi>Tongs</hi> who are now Poſſeſſors of this place, originally deſcended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Swanton Court</hi> was parcel of that Eſtate which claimed the Lords <hi>Leybourn</hi> for Proprietaries, and from them deſcended to the Heir General of the Family, <hi>Iuliana de Leybourn,</hi> who dying in the forty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third without Kindred, or without Iſſue, either by <hi>Haſtings</hi> or <hi>Clinton,</hi> this upon a Defailance of both eſcheated to the Crown, and King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, in the fiftieth year of his Reign ſetled it upon the Abby of <hi>Grace</hi> upon <hi>Tower Hill,</hi> in whoſe Reverue it reſted until the Suppreſſion of that Cloiſter, and then it was by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth in the thirty ſixth year of his Reign granted to <hi>Chriſtopher Sampſon,</hi> and he in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth conveyed it to Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat,</hi> and he being attainted in the ſecond year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> it returned by eſcheat to the Crown, from whence by a new conceſſion it came over to <hi>Reader,</hi> who not many years ſince conveyed his right in it to <hi>Alderſey,</hi> branched out from the ancient Family of <hi>Alderſey,</hi> of <hi>Alderſey</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire:</hi> ſo that it is now the Inheritance of <hi>Terrey Alderſey</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>The Colledge of <hi>Bredgar</hi> was converted from a Pariſh Church, firſt into that we now call a Colledge, by <hi>Robert</hi> then Parſon thereof in the reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, which was eſtablishſd and ratified (ſaith <hi>Harpsfield</hi>) by <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and in this Capacity or poſture it ſtood until the Diſſolution, and then being born away into the royal Revenue, it was by Exchange with the Crown, in the twenty ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, annexed to the revenue for the future of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a place in this Pariſh called <hi>Mans,</hi> as being in elder Times a Manſion of that Name, as Deeds both of an ancient and modern Date do inform me, which whether it were the ancient Seat of the <hi>Mans,</hi> who have ſince been tranſplanted to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; onely it is very probable, becauſe it had Proprietaries of that Denomination, that this was the Fountain whence this Family iſſued forth.</p>

                  <hi>Brenſet</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Aloesbridge</hi> had ſtill the ſame Proprietaries with <hi>Newing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Belhouſe</hi> near <hi>Hieth,</hi> and therefore is called <hi>Newington Brenſet;</hi> and thither for farther ſatisfaction I ſhall refer my Reader, only I muſt inform him, that here is an old Manſion in this Pariſh, which for ſeveral Deſcents was the Seat of the <hi>Edolphs,</hi> before they were tranſplanted to <hi>Hinxhill,</hi> and certainly in elder Times were of good Account in this County, and writ their Names in old Deeds <hi>Edulf;</hi> for ſo is <hi>Stephen Edulf</hi> written in an old Commiſſion, directed to him, <hi>John Peckham</hi> and <hi>Martin Horne,</hi> wherein they were made Collectors for the Cinque Ports in the ſixth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond; but now this Family hath deſerted this Place, having not many years ſince alienated their Intereſt here to Mr. <hi>John Fagge</hi> of <hi>Rye,</hi> Father to <hi>John Fagge</hi> of <hi>Wiſton</hi> in <hi>Suſſex</hi> Eſquire, to whoſe Revenue it remains now annexed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Betſhanger</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Eaſtry,</hi> was in elder Times the Patrimony of a Family called <hi>Marney</hi> or <hi>Marin</hi> for ſo the Name is promiſcuouſly written; <hi>Jo. de Marney,</hi> who is in ſome old Deeds called <hi>Marins,</hi> obtained a Charter of Free Warren to his Mannor of great <hi>Betſhanger</hi> the firſt year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the firſt; but it ſeems this Franchiſe did but improve the Sale, and make it more fit to be enjoyed by another, for not long after it was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>John de Soles,</hi> ſo called from his Habitation near ſome Ponds, and he died in the enjoyment of it, in the forty ninth year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, <hi>Rot.

Bendee</hi> of ſix <hi>Pieces Azure</hi> and <hi>Ermin,</hi> and in this Family it continued until the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then by the Heir General of this Name it became united to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of <hi>Thomas Cox</hi> Eſquire, Cuſtomer of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> who about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, conveyed it by Sale to Mr. <hi>John Bois,</hi> Anceſtor to <hi>John Bois</hi> Eſquire, who by Paternal Devolution is now entituled to the Signory of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Little Betſhanger</hi> was a Seat relating to the Family of <hi>Cliderow,</hi> which in elder Times was of eminent Account in this Track, yet I find that <hi>Iohn de St. Philibert</hi> held Lands here in the thirty firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, but the Mannor it ſelf was an Appendage to the above mentioned Family;
<note n="*" place="margin">He was Knight of the Shire, in the ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth.</note>

                  <hi>Caſtwiſell</hi> is a third place in <hi>Biddenden</hi> worth our Conſideration, it was in Times very ancient Parcel of that Eſtate, which did in this County relate to the <hi>Moiles,</hi> extracted from <hi>Moiles Court</hi> at <hi>Bodmin</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and certainly did as high acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Signory of this Knightly Family, as any Land they held in this County, for though by ſome old Deeds not bounded with any date, I find the Name of <hi>John de Caſtwiſell</hi> affixed as <hi>Teſte,</hi> yet by thoſe old Deeds and Muniments, which have an Aſpect upon this Mannor, I diſcover that <hi>Walter Moile</hi> Knight in the ſixth year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third did grant to <hi>Reginald</hi> and <hi>William Sand:</hi> all thoſe Lands, Tenements, Rents and Services which <hi>Simon Gidinden ad Formam</hi> late held of the ſaid Sit <hi>Walter,</hi> as of his Mannor of <hi>Caſtwiſell,</hi> and by a ſubſequent Deed dated in the twenty third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, I find that <hi>Margaret</hi> Widow of <hi>William Scapis</hi> of <hi>Burmerſh,</hi> did grant to <hi>Walter Moile</hi> which was the Judge, all that Meſſuage and Land ſhe held in <hi>Biddenden,</hi> and by a Deed of a more modern Inſcription, that is one which comences from the twenty ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, I find that <hi>Thomas Moile</hi> of <hi>Eaſtwell</hi> Gentleman, afterwards dignified with the order of Knighthood by the aboveſaid Prince, conveyed it to <hi>Stephen Rogers</hi> Gentleman, and from him is Mr. <hi>Jonathan Rogers,</hi> now poſſeſſor of this place, originally deſcended.</p>

                  <hi>Bidborough</hi> is the laſt place which ſhuts up the <hi>Lowy</hi> of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> here were Lands which were the Inheritance of a Family called <hi>Chauney,</hi> the firſt of whom with whom I meet with in Record is <hi>Thomas le Chauney,</hi> who paid reſpective Aid for it at making the Black Prince Knight (as appears by the Book of <hi>Aid</hi>) in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and continued in his Family divers years after his <hi>Exit;</hi> for in the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, I find <hi>George Chauney</hi> poſſeſt of it; but after him I can trace out no more of this Family who held it; the next who ſucceeded in the Poſſeſſion were the <hi>Palmers,</hi> as is manifeſt by ſome old Court Rolls, which repreſent one <hi>Thomas Palmer</hi> to have been Lord of the Fee in the Reign of <hi>Ed.</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, but made no long ſtay in this Name; for about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, it was alienated to <hi>John Vane</hi> Eſquire, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant of this Family Sir <hi>Ralph Vane</hi> being attainted in the fourth year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the ſixth, it eſcheated to the Crown, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the firſt year of her Rule granted it to <hi>Henry Cary</hi> Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> of whom more hereafter.</p>

                  <hi>Bilſington</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>New-church,</hi> was folded up anciently in that Patrimony which acknowledged the Dominion of <hi>John Manſel,</hi> a man of eminent Note in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, as appears by that Chain of offices which adorned his Greatneſs; for he was Conſtable of <hi>Dover</hi>-Caſtle, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Provoſt of <hi>Beverley,</hi> for the aboveſaid Prince, and Queen <hi>Eleanor</hi> his Wife, and Treaſurer of the Church of <hi>York;</hi> but he not long enjoyed it, for he in the twenty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, made God his Heir, and deveſted himſelf of the propriety of it, to ſettle it on the Priory of <hi>Bilſington,</hi> which was of his Foundation and Endowment, and by dedication entituled to the Patronage of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was furniſhed with white Canons, or Canons <hi>Pramonſtratenſes;</hi> and in this condition did it remain, until not onely this, but all other Orders in this Nation, having warped and revolted from their original Integrity, and thoſe cloſer Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and narrower Reſtraints, the Rules of their primitive Inſtitution tyed them up in, a diſſolution of Mannors called for a Diſſolution of Demeaſn; but now, whether thoſe who did ſo zealouſly pretend to correct their Lives, did not more ſeriouſly intend to reform the Eccleſiaſtical Patrimony, and arraign them, not according to the Guilt of their Crimes, but the Hainouſneſs of their Eſtates, will fall under a ſober Conſideration; that the Exceſſes of the Romiſh Clergie were high, their Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections many, and their Irregularities clamorous, is without controverſie; now what the Cauſes were which unfaſtned the Ligatures of ſtreighter Diſcipline, which like
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103337:46"/>ſo many Nerves did both move and tie together all the Limbs of the Body Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, I ſhall now briefly diſcover: The firſt Cauſe of this Depravation was the removing and abating thoſe Perſecutions which had ſo long with a ſad and bloody preſſure grated upon Chriſtianity, under the Scepter of ten Heathen Tirants; and we know that the Fable tepreſents to us, that when the Laurell, the Guerdon, and Salary of Triumphs, and the Sweat of the Laborious ſhoulder, withered and ſhrunk into Decay, the Figge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttee ſprang up our of its Ruines, which is the Emblematick Type of Softneſs and Effeminacy; and we read that the Lamps of <hi>Tullia</hi> and <hi>Terentia</hi> burnt with a clear and uninterrupted Flame, as long as they were Recluſe to the Cloiſters of their Urnes and Vaults, and dwelt in the Scene and Comprehenſion of Darkeneſs; but when they were brought out into the Publick, like Camphire, they evaporated into the Air that fed them: So the Primitive Chriſtians who ſhone with ſuch a bright and conſtant Beam in the Night and Agony of their Affliction, when they were melted with the warmth and Sun-ſhine or a calme and proſperous Fortune, began to ſlacken into Luxury and Exceſs, Folly and Diſorder; and they that had dared Axes and Racks, Wheels and Gridirons, the Teeth of Beaſts and the Fury of Men, the Heat of Perſecution and the Flame of Oblation; and in brief, had been inexpugnable to all the Artifices and Engines of Torture, contrived by impious men, fell afterwards cheaply and tamely, like thoſe who are ſmothered with Roſes, ſtifled with Perfumes, and ſtrangled with a ſilken Halter. The ſecond Cauſe, that elder obſervations inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate to us, to have been the Reaſon of the Clergies deviation, is, that vaſt heap of temporal Treaſure with which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> loaded the Boſome of the Church; ſo that it may be truly affirmed, <hi>Religio peperit Divitias, &amp; Filia devoravit Matrem;</hi> for Poverty, though like a ſtreight and narrow Girdle it does with its cloſe and uneaſie ſtricture pinch and afflict us, yet it keeps the Garment from falling into Looſneſs and Diſorder; whilſt ſuperfluity of Wealth is apt to untie thoſe Reſtraints which are caſt upon the Will, and unſhackle thoſe Fetters which are laid upon the ſenſual Appetite, rendring our Thoughts vain and trifling, fooliſh and impertinent, and our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings wild and irregular, making us ſoft and eaſie for the impreſſions of Vice; but difficult and uncapable of the influences of Vertue, and the nobler Deſigns of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For it is farther obſervable, that from Riches evaporate the Fumes of Luxury and Ambition, which like thoſe Miſts which exhale from the Crudities of a raw Stomach, debauch the underſtanding, and diſorder Reaſon, and muffle them up in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Acres, which was anciently thought to be as much as one team of Oxen could plough up in a year; but the Tenure it ſelf which was compounded of theſe Knights Fees was altogether incertain, for unleſs it be that Manſcript ſtiled <hi>Modus Tenendi Parliamentum,</hi> which is of no higher Age then the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, there is no Record does ſtate or fix it, <hi>Walter de Meduana</hi> or <hi>Mayney</hi> Anceſtor to the <hi>Mayneys</hi> of <hi>Linton</hi> held twenty Knights Fees as appears by the <hi>Red</hi> Book kept in the Exchequer, <hi>Folio</hi> 84, yet was not under the Repute of a Baron, <hi>Walter de Wahull</hi> had the poſſeſſion of 30.

               <p>There are two Seats within this Pariſh which were alwaies of temporall Intereſt, and pretend to a deep Antiquity; The firſt is <hi>Sundridge,</hi> which formerly was the Patrimony of a noble Family called <hi>Blund, Peter le Blund</hi> was Conſtable of the Tower of <hi>London</hi> the thirty fourth of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Ralph le Blund</hi> his Grandchild paid reſpective Aid for his Lands at <hi>Bromley,</hi> which he there held by a whole Knights Fee of the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> in the twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; and when this Name was entombed in a Female Heir, this Seat went with
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103337:49"/>her to the <hi>Willoughbies,</hi> from whom the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> is deſcended; and when ſome years it had reſted in this Family, by the Circumſtance of Purchaſe, it became the Patrimony of <hi>Booth;</hi> when this Name was likewiſe wound up in an Heir Generall, the <hi>Betenhams</hi> of <hi>Pluckley</hi> by matching with her, became Lords of this Manfion, and and continue ſtill Proprietaries of it.</p>

                  <hi>Simpſons</hi> is the ſecond Seat of Account, though in Ages of a later Inſcription it contracted that Name, yet anciently it was the Demeaſne of <hi>Bankewell,</hi> a Family of Signall Repute in this Track, <hi>John de Bankewell</hi> had a Charter of Free Warren to his Lands in <hi>Bromley,</hi> in which this was involved in the thirty firſt of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Thomas de Bankewell</hi> dyed ſeiſed of it in the thirty fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and when this Family was ſhrunk at this Place into a finall extinction; the next who were eminent in the Poſſeſſion of it, were the <hi>Clarks,</hi> and one <hi>William Clark</hi> that flouriſhed here in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, that he might not be obnoxious to the Statute of Kernellation, obtained Licence to erect a ſtrong little Pile of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

After this Family was worn out, the Poſſeſſion of this Place was united to the Inheritance of <hi>Wode,</hi> and here it remained faſtned untill the thirty fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then <hi>Robert Wode</hi> paſſed it away by Sale to Mr. <hi>Walter Moile,</hi> Father to <hi>John Moile</hi> Esq; who was Juſtice of the Peace for this County, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh; and from whom Mr. <hi>Robert Moile</hi> is lineally branched out, who now enjoys this Manſion: And ſo much for the Seat it ſelf.

From whom it devolved to his Succeſſor <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Lord <hi>Burgherſt</hi> Knight of the Garter, who in the forty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, by a Deed of Feoffment, inveſts it in Sir <hi>Walter de Paveley</hi> Knight likewiſe of the Garter; from <hi>Pavely</hi> it came over by Purchaſe to be the Poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>Robert Belknap</hi> one of the Judges under <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, who

After this Family was diſſeiſed, I find the <hi>Moiles</hi> to have held it as Leſſees to that Covent, untill the general Diſſolution in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then that Prince granted the Fee-Simple to <hi>John Moile</hi> Eſquire, Son of <hi>Robert Moile</hi> Eſquire, who as the Records of this Family reſtifie, was Juſtice of the Peace of this County, and one of the Eſquires of the Body to that Prince, and from this <hi>John Moile</hi> is the Title by Hereditary Succeſſion ſtreamed into Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Moile,</hi> who is the inſtant Lord of the Fee.</p>

                  <hi>Colkins</hi> is the laſt place, though not of the leaſt Account, which in this Pariſh is to be conſidered; it was built by <hi>John Colkin</hi> originally a Citizen of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and he at his Death, which was in the tenth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, was in poſſeſſion of it; there are ſeveral of this Mans Poſterity which lye entombed in <hi>Boughton</hi> with a <hi>Griffin Segreant,</hi> which was their Paternal Coat, affixed to the Front of the Graveſtone, <hi>William Colkin</hi> and <hi>Agnes</hi> his Wife, are there enterr'd with this Inſcription, <hi>Orate pro animâ Will.

                  <hi>Dane Court</hi> in this Pariſh alſo cannot be paſſed by without ſome Inſpection: In elder Times Sir <hi>Allan de Dane</hi> challenged the Signorie of it, and as he took his Sirname from it, ſo he had his Habitation here, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and it continued a Manſion for his Deſcendants divers years after; but in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, I find the <hi>Foggs</hi> Lords of the Fee, the laſt of which that held it was Sir <hi>Jo.

                  <hi>Hauts-bourn</hi> before it was enlarged with the Additional Appellation of <hi>Haut;</hi> afforded both Seat and Sirname in elder Times to a Family of venerable Antiquity in theſe Parts; <hi>John de Bourn</hi> lived here, and had a Charter, of Free-warren granted to it in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Ed.</hi> the firſt; but when this Name reſolved into a Daughter and Heir, who was married to <hi>Shelving,</hi> this Mannor loſt the Name of <hi>Bourn,</hi> and was called by Addition <hi>Shelving Bourn,</hi> and remained ſometime under that Notion, untill a Viciſſitude of the ſame Nature with the former, entombed this in a Female Inheritrix likewiſe, who being married to <hi>Edw.

               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Chilſton</hi> is an eminent Seat and Mannor likewiſe ſituated within the Precincts of this Pariſh: In the fifty fifth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Henry Huſſey</hi> had a Charter of Free-Warren to his Mannor of <hi>Chilſton,</hi> and his Grandchild <hi>Henry Huſſey</hi> died ſeiſed of it in the ſixth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and in this Family was the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in an undivided Succeſſion reſident till our Grandfathers Memory, and then <hi>Henry Huſſey</hi> by Sale tranſlated the Proprietie into <hi>John Parkhurſt,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor Sir <hi>William Parkhurſt</hi> alienated it to <hi>Richard Northwood,</hi> whoſe Son Mr. <hi>Oliver North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> by the ſame tranſmiſſion paſſed it over to <hi>Cieggat;</hi> he very lately diſpoſed of his Concernment in it to Mr. <hi>Manly</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who very lately hath conveyed it to Mr. <hi>Edward Hales,</hi> Grandchild to Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> of <hi>Tunſtal</hi> Knight and Baronet.</p>

                  <hi>Buckland</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> was (as <hi>Sidrach Petits</hi> Inqueſt into the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of <hi>Kent</hi> informs me) as high as the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the Poſſeſſion of <hi>John de Buckland,</hi> who it ſeems extracted his Sirname from hence, and is likewiſe mentioned in <hi>Teſta de Nevil</hi> to have held Land in this Track in the twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third: But before the end of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, this Family was vaniſhed from this place, and immediately after they were gone out, the <hi>Frogenhalls</hi> of <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genhall</hi> in <hi>Tenham,</hi> were entituled to the Poſſeſſion, and <hi>Richard Frogenhall</hi> was ſeiſed of it at his Deceaſe, which was in the thirty fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot.

               <p>There was in old Time a Fountain within the Limits of this Pariſh at a place called <hi>Haly-Garden,</hi> venerable it was, and of no ſmall Account amonſt the People, who for the ſanctitie they conceived was in it, aſcribed divine Attributes unto it, as the Name imports for what we call Holy, our Anceſtors long time ſince ſtyled <hi>Halyg,</hi> as <hi>Halyfax</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> from <hi>holy Haire,</hi> that that the People devoutly eſteemed, and frequently with blind credulity viſited.

               <p>The Mannor of <hi>Dodindale</hi> had originally owners of that Name, for as Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> in his Survey of <hi>Canterbury</hi> out of the Records of St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> inſtructs us, <hi>Haymo</hi> the Son of <hi>Guido de Dodindale,</hi> gave the Tithes of <hi>Dodindale</hi> to the Priory of St. <hi>Auguſtins:</hi> But it ſeems it was but for certain years, for in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond (as the ſame Records teſtifie) <hi>Robert de Marci</hi> gave the Tithes of this place, to the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Laurence;</hi> ſo far he in that laborious Peice of his hath exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the publick view who were its ancient Poſſeſſors when it bore the Name of <hi>Dodindale;</hi> now out of the private Evidences it muſt be my Task who were its Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etaries ſince it carried the Name of <hi>Morton;</hi> By a Deed without date <hi>Elias de Morton</hi> (from whom it aſſumed the Name of <hi>Morton,</hi> which hath clove to it ever ſince) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes the Fee-ſimple of it to <hi>Hugh Fitzvinon,</hi> a Family which had large poſſeſſions at <hi>Selling</hi> by <hi>Monks Horton,</hi> whoſe Daughter <hi>Eugenia Fitzvinon</hi> paſſes it away by Deed to <hi>Nicholas de Twitham</hi> in the twentyeth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and he immediately after by a Deed not bounded with any date, ſettles it in <hi>Robert de Polre;</hi> but whether his Succeſſor ſold it to <hi>J.

               <p>The <hi>Dungeon</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> It was formerly belonging to an ancient Family called <hi>Chich; Ernaldus de Chich</hi> was a man of principal note under <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, and K. <hi>John,</hi> and the Aldermanry of <hi>Burgate</hi> in <hi>Canterbury</hi> did in elder times appertain to this Family; <hi>Thoma.

Acres adjacient to it, but this was not without the Tye or Tribute of ſome Remuneration, for in Autumne <hi>John Chich</hi> who was then Lord of the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> was to receive for his Servants five loaves of Bread, two Pitchers and an half of Beer, and half a Cheeſe of four pence; and he himſelf was to receive <hi>unum par Cirocecarum ferinarum,</hi> one pair of Holyday Gloves, and one pound of Wax in Candles, and for his Servants three pair of Gloves; <hi>Thomas Chich</hi> this mans Son was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> in the forty fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and held his Shrivealtie at the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> but in <hi>Valantine Chich</hi> this mans great Grandchild, not only the male line but likewiſe the poſſeſſion of this place fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for he about the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth paſſed it away to <hi>Roger Brent</hi> Esq; and he died ſeiſed of it (as appears by his Will recorded at <hi>Canterbury</hi>) in the year 1486. But in this Family it was not long after this reſident, for in the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, by an old Court Roll I find one <hi>John Butler</hi> of <hi>Heronden</hi> in <hi>Eaſtrye</hi> poſſeſt of it, and he conveyed it to Sir <hi>John Hales</hi> Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and when <hi>Leland</hi> viſited <hi>Kent,</hi> which was in the thirtieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, he lived here, and from him is it now come down to his Succeſſor Sir <hi>James Hales</hi> the inſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietarie of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moate, alias Wyke,</hi> is a third Mannor within the precincts of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and had owners of that Sirname; For I read in <hi>Teſta de Nevill</hi> that <hi>Stephen de VVyke</hi> poſſeſt it in the twentyeth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and paid reſpective Aid for it at the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Iſabel</hi> that Princes Siſter; and in the Book of <hi>Aid,</hi> where there is an Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ancient owners, there is a Recital of <hi>Stephen de Wyke, William le Taylour, John Tancrey,</hi> and <hi>Richard Betts,</hi> who had an Intereſt in it; but before the beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, all theſe Families were mouldred away and vaniſhed: For in that Kings Reign I find it by the Court Rolls of this place in the hands of Sir <hi>Richard de Hoo,</hi> and <hi>Richard Skippe,</hi> and they about the latter end of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond by deed convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to <hi>Simon Spencer,</hi> and he ſome few years after alienated it to <hi>John Standford</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who ſuddenly after Paſſed it away to <hi>Richard Smith,</hi> in whoſe hands it had not long continued, when the ſame Devolution brought it over to <hi>John Eaſtfield</hi> Eſquire, Son of Sir <hi>William Eaſtfield</hi> who was Knight of the <hi>Bath,</hi> and Lord Maior of <hi>London</hi> in the year 1438. and from him it was by Sale carried off to <hi>William Rogers,</hi> and he by a Fine levied in the thirty third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth demiſes and ſells it to <hi>Philip Belknap</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> Eſquire, Maior of that City in the year 1458. and Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> in the thirty fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth; he married <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Daughter of <hi>John Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi>

               <p>St. <hi>Dunſtans</hi> in <hi>Canterbury</hi> was the Ancient Seat of the noble Family of <hi>Roper, VVilliam Roſper</hi> or <hi>de Rubra Spathâ</hi> for ſo the Name is written in old Dateleſs Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and <hi>Elnith</hi> his Wife the Daughter and Heir of <hi>Edward de Apuldore,</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and were great Benefactors to the Priorie of Saint <hi>Martins</hi> in <hi>Dover, Iohn de Rubrâ Spathâ,</hi> or <hi>Rosper</hi> did eminent Service in <hi>Scotland</hi> under <hi>Edward</hi> the third, for which that Prince rewards him and <hi>William Clifford</hi> (as appears by a Deed recorded in the Earl of <hi>Dorſets</hi> Pedigree) about the twenty ninth year of his Reign, with the third part of thoſe Forfeitures that were due from the <hi>Jews</hi> then inhabiting in <hi>London,</hi> for the Violation of ſome Penal Statutes enected againſt them. <hi>Edmund</hi> Son of <hi>Ralph Roper</hi> was an eminent Man in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, under whom he was Juſtice of the Peace for this County, and died the third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth 1433, and lies buried in this Church of St. <hi>Dunſtans; John Roper</hi> his Son, and <hi>John VVeſtcliffe,</hi> as the Records of this Family inſtruct me, were Correctors and Surveyours of the Cuſtomes of the Cinque Ports in the ninteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh: <hi>Jo.

                  <hi>Challock</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Calehill</hi> hath two places in it, which may deſervedly come within the Regiſter of thoſe Mannors which are in this Survey to be recorded: The firſt is <hi>Otterpley,</hi> which was an eminent Seat belonging to the ancient Family of <hi>Apulderfield.</hi> The firſt that I find of Note in any publick Record to have poſſeſt it, was <hi>Henry de Apulderfield,</hi> who had the Grant of a Market and Fayre to his Mannor of <hi>Apulderfield</hi> in <hi>Coldham,</hi> in the thirty eighth year of <hi>Hen.</hi> the third; and this mans great Grandchild <hi>Henry de Apulderfield</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> the fiftieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and held his Shrievalty at <hi>Challock.</hi> His Houſe was near <hi>Eaſt-well</hi> in the Earl of <hi>Winchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys</hi> upper Park, called <hi>Apulderfields Garden,</hi> which is now ſo obſcured in its own Ruins, that we now with Difficulty trace out its Sepulcher, made up of its own complicated Rubbiſh; but this Mannor, as to ſome Proportion of it, was paſſed away before he was Sheriff, to <hi>Edmund de Hant,</hi> who held it at his Deceaſe, which was in the forty fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; but neither of theſe Families laſted longer then the Beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond; for then I find it entirely inveſted in <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Poynings,</hi> who in the eleventh year of that Prince was poſſeſt of it at his Death, and left it to his Sole Heir, <hi>Eleanor</hi> matched to <hi>Henry Percy</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> in whoſe Succeſſors the Right was conſtantly fixed, until the twenty third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was conveyed by <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> to Sir <hi>Thomas Cheyney, William Walſingham,</hi> and <hi>William Fitz-Williams,</hi> and they immediately after re-conveyed it to Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hales,</hi> and his Son Sir <hi>James Hales</hi> about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth alienated it to Sir <hi>Thomas Moile,</hi> by whoſe Daughter and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heir <hi>Katharine,</hi> it came to be the Inheritance of Sir <hi>Thomas Finch,</hi> unhappily Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wract by <hi>New-Haven</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> a Perſon who deſerved a longer Life, and not ſo dark a Fate; from whom by paternal Deſcent it is now tranſmitted to the right honourable <hi>Heneage Finch</hi> now Earl of <hi>Winchelſey.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Loringden</hi> and <hi>Deane</hi> are places in <hi>Challock</hi> worthy of Conſideration. There is a Tradition very frequent amongſt the Country people in this Track, that <hi>Loringden</hi> now altogether deſolate and full of ſolitude, was once the Manſion of Gentlemen of this Name, one of which ſhould have waged Combate with one of the <hi>Apulderfields</hi> of <hi>Otterpley</hi> not far diſtant, about building a Chappel in the Valley, which was pretended by <hi>Loringden</hi> to be erected on Land that was of his Fee-ſimple; but becauſe this without ſome more ſolid Foundation to ſupport then Fame and Vulgar Report, will appear but legend, I will re-preſent to you what the original Muniments and Evidences have diſcovered to me in Relation to thoſe who were Poſſeſſors of this place. That there was a Family which bore the Name of <hi>Lourdingden</hi> or <hi>Loringden,</hi> is moſt certain, for there is a place in <hi>Challock</hi> which yet continues the Name of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindens Foreſtal;</hi> but when I conſulted the private Evidences of this place, I found upon a ſerious Diſquition they reached no higher then <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and in his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103337:56"/>Reign, it acknowledged it ſelf to be of the Propriety of <hi>Cadman,</hi> a Family grown into a reverend eſteem by a long Preſcription in this Track; but the Name of <hi>Dean</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in being till the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and was in very ancient Deeds, ſome of which are not limited with any Date, written <hi>At Dean</hi> and <hi>A Dean,</hi> and in that Princes Reign was by Sale paſſed away to the above mentioned Family of <hi>Cadman;</hi> in which Name both <hi>Loringdean</hi> and <hi>Dean</hi> remained clapſed up, till the entrance of K. <hi>James,</hi> and then by a Sole Daughter and Heir they went over to <hi>Plomer,</hi> who almoſt in our Memory transferred his Right in both of them by Sale to <hi>Peirce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Challock</hi> being fallen down, was new erected by the <hi>Apulderfields,</hi> as the Glaſs windows and Stone work in divers places, embroider'd and diaper'd with the <hi>Voided Croſs,</hi> which was their paternal Coat Armour, do more then ſufficiently teſtifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cranebrook</hi> gives name to the Hundred wherein it is ſeated, a Town very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, in reſpect it was one of the firſt places where the Manufacture of Clothing was profeſſed and practiſed, being brought into <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds Reign, who by propoſing rewards, and granting many Immunities, trained <hi>Flemings</hi> into this Nation in the tenth year of his reign, to teach the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that Art of Draperie, or Weaving and making woollen Cloth, which is eſteemed at this day, one of the Buttereſſe which ſuſtains the Common-wealth; and certainly for making durable Broad clothes with very good Mixtures and perfect Colours, <hi>Cranebrook</hi> doth with the moſt that way excell.</p>
               <p>The firſt place of note in it, which obviates the eye, is <hi>Siſingherſt;</hi> but more properly and truly written <hi>Saxenhurſt;</hi> and as <hi>Bittenden,</hi> not far diſtant derives its Name from the <hi>Brittons,</hi> ſo in moſt probability did this take and aſſume its Denomination from the <hi>Saxons.</hi> In <hi>Teſta de Nevil,</hi> a Book kept in the Exchequer, which is a memorial of thoſe who holding their Lands in the Knights Service paid relief in the twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> third, towards the Marriage of the Kings Siſter. There is mention of <hi>John de Saxenhurſt</hi> who was taxed for his Lands here at <hi>Cranebrook,</hi> which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was this <hi>Siſingherſt,</hi> with the two little Mannors of <hi>Copton</hi> and <hi>Stone;</hi> which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the ſame Owners with <hi>Siſingherſt:</hi> In times of a more modern Character, the <hi>Berhams</hi> by the Female Heirs of <hi>Saxenhurſt</hi> were Lords of <hi>Siſingherſt,</hi> with its two adjuncts <hi>Copton</hi> and <hi>Stone; Richard de Berham</hi> who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> in the forty fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third was here reſident, and is written of this place; and <hi>Henry de Berham</hi> this mans Father paid reſpective Aid at the making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, for ſundry parcels of Land which he held in <hi>Kent,</hi> and amongſt the reſt, for his Lands at <hi>Cranebrook;</hi> and in this Family was the poſſeſſion of this place, with that of <hi>Copton</hi> and <hi>Stone</hi> concentered till the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and then part of <hi>Siſingherſt</hi> with <hi>Copton</hi> and <hi>Stone</hi> was ſold to Mr. <hi>Tho. Baker</hi> Father to Sir <hi>John Baker</hi> Attorney General, and of the Privy Counſel to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and likewiſe Chancellor of the Exchequer, and under-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, who purchaſed the reſidue, and raiſed that Magnificent Pile within the Park, which now charmes with ſo much Delight the eyes of the Spectators; and from this man by the channel of paternal and lineal Deſcent is the Inheritance of <hi>Siſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſt, Copton,</hi> and <hi>Stone,</hi> emptied into Sir <hi>John Baker</hi> Baronet, the inſtant Lord of the Fee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Glaſtenbury</hi> is not to be forgotten, ſince it is of ſo great a Name elſewhere, and is called as the other is from <hi>Glaſtney</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> Idiome of <hi>Inis Witrin,</hi> the Watry or Glaſſie place. The Houſe which ſtands in a Park is moated about, and hath been for many Generations the capital Manſion of the ancient Family of <hi>Rokchurſt,</hi> ever ſince <hi>Stephen Rokehurſt</hi> or <hi>Roberts</hi> of <hi>Curteſden,</hi> and in old Records ſometimes written <hi>Rokehurſt Den</hi> in <hi>Goudherſt,</hi> about the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth married <hi>Joan</hi> Sole Heir of <hi>William Tilley</hi> of <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> (whoſe Anceſtors had flouriſhed at this place, as private Evidencs inſtruct me, ever ſince the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt) and in right of that Alliance became Lord of this Manſion. This <hi>Stephen Roberts, aliàs Rokehurſt,</hi> was Grand-child of <hi>William Roberts, aliàs Rokehurſt,</hi> and that <hi>William</hi> was great Grand-child of <hi>William de Rokehurſt,</hi> who in the reign of <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as the Evidences of this Family inform me, came out of <hi>Anandale</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103337:56"/>
                  <hi>England;</hi> and to preſerve the memory of this man, did the Family till the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, write <hi>Roberts alias Rokchurſt,</hi> till in the Eaſt window of the North Chancel of the Church of <hi>Cranebrook,</hi> which was built by <hi>Walur Roberts</hi> Eſq; in that Princes Reign, as alſo in moſt of his Deeds and Conveyences the <hi>alias</hi> was left out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Courſehorne</hi> finds place to be remembred in the Map of <hi>Kent,</hi> and then muſt not be forgotten here; it hath been for above three hundred years (as appears by private Records) the Inheritance of <hi>Henley,</hi> in an Eſcheat Roll taken in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and marked with the number 92. After the death of <hi>Richard Haudloe,</hi> who it ſeems had Lands at <hi>Cranebrook,</hi> there is mention of one <hi>Gerva; Henley</hi> that was one of the Jury and concerned in the Inquiſition: But that which much improves the Fame of this Manſion, is, that it was the Cradle of Sir <hi>Walter Henley</hi> Serjeant at Law, a man of eminent repute in this County in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and by his three Daughters and Coheirs, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> married to ....... <hi>Waller</hi> of <hi>Grome-bridge, Hellen</hi> firſt matched to <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> of <hi>Bedgbury,</hi> ſecondly to Sir <hi>George Somerſett,</hi> and thirdly to <hi>Thomas Vane</hi> of <hi>Burſton;</hi> and laſtly <hi>Ann</hi> wedded to <hi>Richard Covert</hi> of <hi>Slaugham</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> knit thoſe Noble Families together in one Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but <hi>Courſehorne</hi> did by Deſcent come over to his Brother <hi>Gervas Henley</hi> Eſquire, from whom Sir <hi>Thomas Henley</hi> now of <hi>Courſehorne</hi> is lineally extracted.</p>
               <p>Another ancient place there is in <hi>Cranebrook,</hi> called <hi>Hartridge,</hi> the poſſeſſion in times paſt of a worthy Family of that Sirname, among them chiefly to be remembred is <hi>Thomas Hartridge,</hi> for he was one of the Conſervators or Juſtices of Peace in this County in the thirty fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, when there was but eight only in the whole Shire. It hath been ſince much honoured by the <hi>Will fords,</hi> who by <hi>James Willsford</hi> a moſt worthy Senator of <hi>London,</hi> derive themſelves from the right ancient Family of <hi>Willsford</hi> of <hi>Willsford</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and are fairly ſpread from hence into many Branches both in this County, and elſewhere; and after it had thus for divers Deſcents been reſident in this noble Family, the Poſſeſſion was in our Fathers remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance united by purchaſe to the Patrimony of <hi>Tindall,</hi> now of <hi>Sutton Valence.</hi>

               <p>Fifthly <hi>Betenham</hi> is not to be paſſed over in ſilence, which is a Note worthy Place in this Pariſh, that gave both Seat and Sirname to the <hi>Betenhams,</hi> but when the eldeſt Line had only three Daughters and Coheirs, matched to <hi>More, Dering,</hi> and <hi>Fiſher,</hi> who divided the Patrimony, this in his Wifes right was annexed to the Demeaſn of <hi>More,</hi> and this after <hi>More</hi> had alienated his Intereſt in it, came to acknowledge for Sole Owners the <hi>Roes,</hi> of which Family was the right Noble Sir <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> Knight, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the moſt Noble Order of the Garter, and of the Privy Councel to the late Kidg <hi>Charles,</hi> and ſeverall years Embaſſador to the Great <hi>Mogor,</hi> Great <hi>Turk,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and laſtly to the Princes of the Proteſtant Union in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the year 1642. After which Negotiation moſt prudently tranſfacted, he returned, and died; but in this Family it remained not long, for in the remembrance of that Age our Fathers lived in, it was by Sale demiſed to <hi>Mansfield,</hi> in whom the Poſſeſſion is at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſetled.</p>
               <p>There are two places more which may be regiſtred in this Inventorie. The firſt is <hi>Plechinghurſt,</hi> which was an ancient Seat belonging to the <hi>Sharpeighs</hi> of <hi>Sharpeigh,</hi> a Family of deep rooted Antiquitie in this Track; <hi>Robert de Sharpeigh</hi> flouriſhed here at <hi>Cranebrook</hi> about the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and was witneſs to a Deed of <hi>William de Brindens</hi> of <hi>Brinden:</hi> In this Pariſh formerly the <hi>Linds,</hi> and now the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens;</hi> but this Deed is without Date: another <hi>Robert Sharpeigh</hi> of <hi>Sharpeigh</hi> and <hi>Crane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,</hi> as I find by an ancient Roll was in Commiſſion as Juſtice of the Peace about the latter end of the Government of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh: But as all ſublunary things are cruſhed and overturned by the wheel of an inconſtant Viciſſitude, ſo by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence are our Poſſeſſions likewiſe; for, after this place had been for ſo many Deſcents the Inheritance of this ancient Family, it was almoſt within the Verge of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, firſt alienated to <hi>Martin,</hi> and by him not long ſince by Sale de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Walter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is <hi>Buckhurſt,</hi> which is the laſt place of Account within the circuit of this Pariſh. If we go to trace the Antiquity of thſe Families, who were the ancient Proprietorrs of it, we ſhall find that it acknowledged <hi>Hadloe</hi> and <hi>Buckhurſt</hi> for its elder
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103337:57"/>Poſſeſſors, that the firſt had ſome concernment here, not only the private Deeds and Muniments of this place do evince to us, but likewiſe by an Inquiſition taken after the deceaſe of <hi>Richard de Hadloe,</hi> by which it is evident he held ſome Eſtate here in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 32. And that the ſecond Family had ſome Intereſt here, not only the Authority aboveſaid doth juſtifie, but the Name it ſelf doth tacitly inſinuate that this Manſion formerly gave Seat and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination to the Family of <hi>Buckhurſt;</hi> in times of a lower ſtep, that is, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, I find it in the Tenure of <hi>Drayner;</hi> but how it devolved to this Family, I cannot diſcover; It is enough that it continued united to their Dimeaſn, untill the beginning of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then it was conveyed to <hi>Alexander Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> in whoſe Deſcendant the Signorie and Intereſt of it hath ever ſince been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reſident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cranebroke</hi> had the Grant of a Market to be obſerved weekly there on the <hi>Saturday,</hi> in the eighteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, as appears <hi>Cart. Edw.</hi> 1. <hi>Num.</hi> 92.</p>
               <p>I had almoſt forgot to tell you that there is a place in this Pariſh called <hi>Holden,</hi> which with <hi>Hawkeridge</hi> hath for ſome Centuries of years acknowledged the <hi>Holdens</hi> for its Proprietaries, and are ſtill united to the Patrimony of this Name and Family, which for ſuch a vaſt Succeſſion of time hath been planted at <hi>Cranebroke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a Chappell at a place called <hi>Milkhouſe,</hi> in the Eaſtern part of this Pariſh founded and endowed by <hi>John Lawleſs,</hi> about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, which upon the generall Diſſolation of Chantries and all other Religious Fraternities by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, was by that Prince about the latter end of his Rule granted to Sir <hi>John Baker</hi> of <hi>Siſingherſt</hi> not far diſtant, whoſe Revenue is yet in the poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>John Baker</hi> his Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>There was another Chappell founded at <hi>Siſingherſt</hi> (as the Evidences of that place do inſinuate) by <hi>John de Saxenhurſt;</hi> which was reedified by the late Sir <hi>John Baker,</hi> and by a Deed delivered to <hi>John Bancroft</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oxford</hi> devoted to the Service of God, and dedicated as it was before to St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt:</hi> After the reception of this Inſtrument, which was in the year 1637. it was by the ſame Biſhop Conſecrated; firſt, by a Prayer at the entrance of the Chappell, then by others made at the Seats, Pulpit, and Communion Table; the effect of all which was, that God would accept of it for a Houſe, and likewiſe of the Prayers and Devotions that in that Oratorie were offered up by the faithful People of God to his Honour and Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charing</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Calehill,</hi> is in <hi>Saxon</hi> written <hi>Cering,</hi> and by that Name King <hi>Kenulf</hi> in the year 799. made Reſtitution of it to <hi>Chriſt Church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury</hi> at the humble requeſt of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Athelard,</hi> for King <hi>Offa</hi> had taken it away from that Church in the time of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Janibert;</hi> and being thus regained to the See, it continued ſo till the great Exchange made in the twenty ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth with that Prince by Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer;</hi> the Fee-ſimple was planted in the Crown: In the time of the Conqueſt in the Notitia of the Arch-Biſhop and Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals Lands, becauſe they held it in ancient Demeaſn (that is, they had poſſeſt it long before the Conqueſt) and a Mannor-houſe or Palace there, it was called <hi>Proprium Manerium Archiepiſcopi.</hi> In the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor it went for eight Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings or Plough-Lands, but in the twentieth year of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour it was rated in <hi>Domſday</hi> Book at ſeven Sullings, becauſe one Plough-Land was laid into his Demeaſn. The Church dedicated to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> was anciently famous by a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional relation, (which I am not much moved with, for it wants the ſtamp of venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authority) which did affirm, that the Block on which St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſts Head was cut off, was brought into <hi>England</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, and kept in this Church.</p>
               <p>The firſt place of ſecular Intereſt which doth occurre, is <hi>Pett,</hi> the Evidences of this place now in the hands of Sir <hi>Robert Honywood</hi> do mention the <hi>Petts</hi> to be in Ages of a very high Aſſent, that is, about the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, Proprietaries of it but publick Records reach no farther than <hi>Newcourt</hi> Lord of the Mannor of <hi>Newcourt</hi> not far diſtant; <hi>Jeffrey de Newcourt</hi> Son of <hi>Walter de Newcourt</hi> paid reſpective Aid in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third for his Lands at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> and <hi>Pett.</hi> After the <hi>Newcourts</hi> were gone out, the <hi>Hatches</hi> were by Purchaſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103337:57"/>planted at <hi>Pett</hi> and <hi>Newcourt;</hi> they were called ſo from their abode near ſome Gate or paſſage, for one of them who was Poſſeſſor of theſe two places, was written <hi>Hugh at Hatch;</hi> from this Family by Sale about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, the right of <hi>Pett</hi> and <hi>Newcourt</hi> devolved to <hi>William Warham;</hi> and in ſome Copies of Fines which I have ſeen by a falſe Tranſcription written <hi>William VVarren,</hi> and this man ſold them both again in the entrance of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth to <hi>Robert Atwater,</hi> who determining in <hi>Mary Atwater</hi> his Sole Heir, She by matching with <hi>Robert Honywood</hi> Eſquire of <hi>Henewood</hi> in <hi>Poſtling,</hi> wound up the Intereſt of theſe two places <hi>Pett</hi> and <hi>Newcourt</hi> into the Demeaſn of that Family, ſo that they now own Sir <hi>Robert Honywood</hi> his great Grandchild the Sole Proprietary of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stilley</hi> is another little Mannor lying within <hi>Charing,</hi> and was anciently enwrapt in the Revenue of <hi>Frene, John de Frene</hi> who flouriſhed in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, is mentioned in <hi>Teſta de Nevill,</hi> a Book collected in the twentieth year of that Prince, to have paid Aid at the Marriage of the Kings Sider, for Lands which he poſſeſt at <hi>Charing;</hi> after in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, there is a recital in the Book of <hi>Aid</hi> of Sir <hi>Thomas de Brockhull</hi> Son of Sir <hi>William de Brockhull,</hi> who paid an Auxiliary ſupply at the making of the Black Prince Knight for his Lands which he held at <hi>Saltwood, Calehill, Charing,</hi> and other places in this County; but after this the Poſſeſſion was not long reſident in this Family, for <hi>Henry Brockhull</hi> this mans ſecond Son, to whom theſe Mannors of <hi>Stilley</hi> and <hi>Newland</hi> were aſſigned for livelyhood, about the twelfth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, tranſmitted them by Sale to <hi>John Darell</hi> Eſquire, Son of Sir <hi>William Darell,</hi> who was extracted out of the right ancient and Knightly Family of the <hi>Darells</hi> of <hi>Seſay;</hi> from whom Sir <hi>John Darell</hi> of <hi>Calehill,</hi> and Lord of this Mannor of <hi>Stilley,</hi> is originally and lineally iſſued out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wickins</hi> is another Mannor circumſcribed within the Limits of this Pariſh, it was originally the Patrimony of <hi>Brent,</hi> a Family well endowed in this Track, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was as ancient a Seat of this Family as any which lay involved in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, for <hi>John Brent</hi> Son of <hi>Robert de Brent</hi> of <hi>Charing</hi> paid reſpective Aid for Lands which he held here in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>William Brent</hi> who was Son of <hi>Hugh Brent</hi> of <hi>Charing,</hi> made his Will the twenty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and diſpoſed of this place to his Son <hi>Hugh Brent;</hi> and this <hi>Hugh</hi> had Iſſue <hi>William Brent,</hi> who compoſed his Teſtament in the tenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh; and this <hi>William</hi> was great Grandfather to <hi>Thomas Brent,</hi> in whom the Male Line determined, ſo that <hi>Margaret</hi> his Siſter became his Sole Heir, who by matching with <hi>Jo. Dering</hi> of <hi>Surrenden Dering</hi> Eſquire, hath made <hi>Wickins</hi> ever ſince parcel of the Demeaſn of that Name and Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Newland</hi> is another eminent Mannor in <hi>Charing,</hi> which gave Seat and Sirname to a Family ſo ſtyled: Sir <hi>John de Newland</hi> lived here in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and ſealed with an <hi>Eſcollop</hi> upon a <hi>Cheveron</hi> for his Coat, which is yet viſible in ancient Regiſters, and other venerable Monuments of Antiquity; but before the latrer end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, this Family was extinguiſhed at this place, and then it became parcel of the noble Family of <hi>Brockhull</hi> of <hi>Cale-Hill,</hi> and continued folded up in their Poſſeſſion untill the twelfth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and then it was paſſed away by Deed from <hi>Henry Brockhull</hi> to <hi>John Darrell</hi> Eſquire, from whom it is by ſucceſſive Devolution now tranſported to his Succeſſor Sir <hi>John Darrell</hi> of <hi>Cale-Hill</hi> Knight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Everſley</hi> next courts us to a Remembrance, it lies partly in <hi>Charing,</hi> and partly in <hi>Stacefield,</hi> and though now obſcure, yet in elder times was made eminent by being one of the Manſions of <hi>Brian de Everſley,</hi> a Man very eminent in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third and <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and is mentioned in the <hi>Leiger</hi> Book of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> to have been a Benefactor to that Covent; but his Piety could not ſecure the Title to his Poſterity, for about the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, I find it planted in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>Peiferer,</hi> by the Heir General of which Family called <hi>Julian,</hi> it came to be the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Thomas St. Leger,</hi> and he died poſſeſt of it in the tenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and bequeathed it to <hi>Mary</hi> his Daughter and Coheir, eſpouſed to <hi>Henry Aucher,</hi> from whom it was wafted down by deſcendant Right to his Succeſſor Sir <hi>Anthony Aucher,</hi> who about the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> alienated it to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103337:58"/>
                  <hi>Michael Sond;</hi> Eſquire, afterwards created Sir <hi>Michael Sonds,</hi> from whom it is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved to his Deſcendant Sir <hi>George Sonds</hi> Knight of the <hi>Bath.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tremhatch</hi> in old Deeds <hi>Tramhatch,</hi> lies likewiſe in <hi>Charing,</hi> and is advanced and aſcended to ſome Note and Eſtimate, ſince it was honoured by being parcel of the Patrimony of <hi>Barham,</hi> a Family which was made ſplendid by an eminent Repute, and no leſs conſiderable by a ſpreading Revenue which they held in this County, of whom I ſhall ſpeak more when I come to <hi>Barham Court</hi> in <hi>Terſtan,</hi> one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Manſions of this Name: Finally, after it had for ſeveral Deſcents confeſſed the Propriety of this Family, it was by <hi>Richard Barham</hi> conveyed by a Fine levied the eleventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth to <hi>John Haut,</hi> where the Title was not ſo fixed as in the former, for he not long after by a ſemblable Alteration paſſed it away to <hi>Henry Malmains,</hi> and who about the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth determined in two Daughters and Coheirs, whereof was <hi>Agnes</hi> wedded to <hi>Thomas Gouldwell,</hi> and ſo by this Alliance <hi>Tremhatch</hi> was enwrapped in his Patrimony, and continued in the Deſcendants of this Name untill the forty ſecond year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then it was alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by <hi>John Gouldwell</hi> and <hi>Cicely</hi> his Wife to <hi>Robert Gaunt,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Thomas Gaunt</hi> died poſſeſt of it 1625, and gives it firſt to his Brother <hi>George Gaunt,</hi> and in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failance of Iſſue to <hi>Thomas Carliſle,</hi> who in Right of the premiſes is now inveſted in the Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Broughton</hi> is a Mannor which is likewiſe circumſcribed within the Limits of <hi>Charing,</hi> and had Owners likewiſe of that Sirname. <hi>Adam de Broughton</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times written <hi>Brocton,</hi> flouriſhed here about the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and his Deſcendants enjoyed the Proprietie of it untill the latter end of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and then it was alienated to <hi>Paunſherſt, Thomas Paunſherſt</hi> made his Will in the year of our Lord 1472, and gave it to <hi>Thomas Paunſherſt</hi> his Son, and he made his Will in the year 1503, and diſpoſed of it to his Daughter <hi>Joan Paunſherſt,</hi> and in Defailance of her Iſſue, to his Kinſman <hi>Thomas Paine;</hi> She deceaſed without Iſſue, and ſo the Remainder devolved to be the Inheritance of <hi>Paine,</hi> in which Name it remained untill times of our remembrance, and then it was alienated to the Father of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Proprietary, <hi>Withick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here was a <hi>Chauntry</hi> at <hi>Charing</hi> founded, as an ancient Survey of this Pariſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs me, by Sir <hi>Iohn Burley,</hi> who bare Quarterly <hi>Or</hi> and <hi>Sables,</hi> and was called ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively <hi>Burley</hi>'s <hi>Chauntry</hi> the Duty enjoyned the Prieſt that was to officiate, was to pray for the Soules of Sir <hi>Iohn Burley,</hi> Sir <hi>William de Burleigh,</hi> and the Deſcendants of that Family, the Demeaſn which was to ſupport it, was upon the ſuppreſſion granted to Sir <hi>Io.

               <p>
                  <hi>Acton</hi> is the laft place of Account in <hi>Charing,</hi> which is eminent in reſpect of that relation it had to the ancient and noble Family of <hi>Beaufits,</hi> who made it their Seat before they were tranſplanted to <hi>Twidal</hi> in <hi>Gillingham. Robert Beaufits,</hi> as appears by an ancient Court Roll held it in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and from him did it deſcend to his Grandchild <hi>Robert Beaufits,</hi> who about the fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, planted himſelf at <hi>Twidal:</hi> but yet this ſtill continued in the Name untill the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and then this Name expiring in Daughters and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs, one of them called <hi>Ioan</hi> by matching with <hi>Robert Arnold</hi> made it the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of that Family, and he had Iſſue <hi>William Arnold,</hi> who conveyed it about the the middle of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth to Sir <hi>Anthony Sonds,</hi> whoſe Grandchild Sir <hi>Richard Sonds</hi> in our Fathers remembrance alienated it to <hi>Hutchins,</hi> from whom by the Hands of Mr. <hi>Nicholas Nicholſon,</hi> who was made his Feoffee in Truſt to diſcharge Debts and Legacies, it is now come over to <hi>Godden.</hi>

                  <hi>Chartham</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Bredge</hi> and <hi>Petham,</hi> is a Mannor belonging to the Sea of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but of whoſe Donation I know not; onely <hi>Doomſday</hi> Book repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it thus appraiſed, <hi>Certeham eſt Manerium de veſtitu Monachorum, &amp; T.

               <p>
                  <hi>Denſted</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Chartham,</hi> which in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:103337:58"/>the third was held by <hi>John</hi> the Son of Sir <hi>John Polre</hi> of <hi>Polre</hi> in <hi>Harbledowne,</hi> but onely as Leſſee to the Priory of <hi>Leeds,</hi> to which Covent it was given by <hi>Hamon de Crevequer</hi> about the forty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>pro ſalute Animae ſuae &amp; Anteceſſorum ſuorum,</hi> ſays an old Note extracted out of the <hi>Coucher</hi> Book of the Prioty; yet the whole Mannor did not accrue to this Cloiſter by the former Donation, for in the eighth year of <hi>Rich.</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Rob. Bovehatch,</hi> as appears, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 81. being convicted of Felony, was found to have held ſome Land here at <hi>Denſted,</hi> which upon the Forfeiture, was by that Prince, it is probable, as was cuſtomary in thoſe times, ſettled on the Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Leeds,</hi> and lay wholly couched in their Revenue until the publick Diſſolution in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth rent it off, and then it was in the thirty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth granted to <hi>John Tufton</hi> Eſquire, and he about the third year of <hi>Ed.</hi> the ſixth alienated it to <hi>Richard Argal</hi> Eſquire; from whom not long after it came over by Sale to Mr. <hi>Bartholomew Man,</hi> and he about the Beginning of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> conveyed it by Sale to <hi>William Lovelace</hi> Eſquire, Serjeant at Law to that Princeſs; and his Son Sir <hi>Will.

               <p>
                  <hi>Howfield</hi> is a ſecond place which calls for our Notice, it was as high as any Evidence can furniſh me with Intelligence, to ſteer me on to any old Diſcovery, the Patrimonial Inheritance of <hi>Fogge,</hi> a noble and Knightly Family as any in this Track: Sir <hi>Thomas Fogge</hi> who inhabited at <hi>Toniford,</hi> about the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, purchaſed this and <hi>Toniford</hi> of <hi>John de Toniford,</hi> about the laſt year of that Princes Rule, and in the Revenue of this Family did the Title of this Mannor for many Deſcents lye rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up, till ſome few Generations ſince it was alienated to <hi>Colepeper,</hi> where after ſome ſhort reſidence, the Poſſeſſion by the ſame Fate was tranſplanted into <hi>Vane,</hi> from whom not many years ſince it went away by Sale to Sir <hi>Will.

It was for many Generations the Inheritance of a Family which had here their Seat, and derived from hence their Sirname, and continued down in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted ſucceſſion in the Poſſeſſion of this Family, until about the beginning of the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, (as appears by the Deed which I have ſeen) <hi>Ann</hi> Daughter and Sole Heir of <hi>William Shalmesford</hi> was wedded to <hi>John Petit,</hi> and ſo by this Alliance the Fee-ſimple of this place was lincked to their Patrimony; but in our Fathers Memory the Tie was broken, for <hi>William Petit</hi> this Mans Succeſſor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed without Iſſue Male, and left onely three Daughters his Coheirs, <hi>Katharine</hi> married to <hi>Michael Belke, Elizabeth</hi> matched to <hi>Giles Maſters,</hi> and laſtly <hi>Dorothy</hi> eſpouſed firſt to <hi>William Maſters,</hi> ſecondly to <hi>John Meriwether,</hi> and thirdly to ...... <hi>Parker</hi> of <hi>North-Fleet,</hi> who ſhared his Revenue; but this upon the ſeparation of the Eſtate, did improve the Demeaſn of <hi>Michael Belke</hi> with its acceſſion, from whom it is deſcended to the preſent owner Mr. ....... <hi>Belke,</hi> now Vicar of <hi>Wye,</hi> iſſued out from the <hi>Belkes</hi> of <hi>Coperham</hi>'s <hi>Sole</hi> in <hi>Shelvich,</hi> which hath been in the Tenure and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, as it now is, of this Name and Family, as the private Evidences of the place do manifeſt, almoſt four hundred years.</p>
               <p>There is yet another petty Mannor in <hi>Chartham</hi> called <hi>Shalmesford Street,</hi> but more truly and originally the Manſion of <hi>Bolles,</hi> for it was the Intereſt of that Name and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily who had large Poſſeſſions at <hi>Chilham</hi> and the parts adjacent, but upon my view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the private Evidences of this place, ſome of which reached to <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, I could not diſcover that any of them were ever repreſented under the notion of Gentlemen, or that there was any Coat of Arms inſculped on their Seats, after <hi>Bolles</hi> was worn out, which was about the beginning of the reign of Q, <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Poſſeſſion was by Sale ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to <hi>Cracknal,</hi> from whom in that Age which bordered upon our remembrance, it was by the ſame Fatality conveyed away to <hi>Michel,</hi> who claims the preſent Poſſeſſion of it.</p>

                  <hi>Chetham</hi> with <hi>Gillingham</hi> are knit into one Hundred, ſo that it gives Name to that Track wherein it is ſituared; it was in Ages of a very high Pedigree, the Seat of the Potent, Ancient, and Illuſtrious Family of <hi>Crevequer,</hi> and was <hi>Caput Baroniae,</hi> or the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103337:59"/>principal Mannor which related to their Barony, before they tranſplanted themſelves to <hi>Leeds</hi> Caſtle, and frequently writ <hi>Domini de Cetham; Hamon de Crevequer</hi> lived in the Time of the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and is mentioned in the great Survey, ſtyled <hi>Deomeſday</hi>-Book, and he had Iſſue <hi>Robert Crevequer,</hi> or <hi>de Crepite Corde,</hi> who was joyned as an Aſſiſtant to <hi>John Fiennes</hi> in the Guard of <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle, and he was Grand-father to <hi>Robert Crevequer</hi> who erected <hi>Leeds</hi> Caſtle, and had Iſſue <hi>Hamon de Crevequer,</hi> who matched with <hi>Matilda de Averenches,</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>William de Averenches,</hi> by whom he had Iſſue <hi>Hamon de Crevequer,</hi> who was ſo involved in the Deſign and Combination of <hi>Simon de Montfort,</hi> which was to retrench the Prerogative of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, that he made the Breaſt of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> eldeſt Son to that King, boile with ſo much Paſſion and Animoſity, that it could not be appeaſed or allayed, until he had appointed <hi>Henry Cobbam</hi> his Subſtitute in his Conſtableſhip of <hi>Dover,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantle and raze his Caſtle at <hi>Leeds,</hi> and ſeiſe on this Mannor as the Expiation and recompenſe of ſo great a Defection and Folly; and although his Crimes were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards abſolved and entombed in the Pacification of <hi>Killingworth,</hi> yet I do not find that ever <hi>Chetham</hi> was reſtored to him, for in the tenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, that Prince exchanges this Mannor and divers other pieces of Land with <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Lord <hi>Badeleſmer,</hi> for the Mannor of <hi>Adreſley</hi> and the Advowſon of the Church in <hi>Shropſhire:</hi> But he ſoon after inſculped theſe Benefits of the Kings in Sand, a weak Regiſter to record ſo many important Obligations, and by his Confederacy with <hi>Tho.</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and others of the mutinous Nobility, forfeited both this and his life at <hi>Canterbury;</hi> upon whoſe Tragedie it reſolved again into the Revenue of the Crown, and there reſted until K. <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, in the ſecond year of his Reign reſtored it again to his Son <hi>Bartholomew Badeleſmer,</hi> and he dying in the twelfth year of that Kings Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment without Iſſue, <hi>Margaret</hi> matched to <hi>William Roſſe,</hi> and re-married to <hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> and <hi>Margery</hi> another of his Siſters matched to Sir <hi>Jo. de Tib itot,</hi> and Co-heirs, ſhared his Inheritance at this place.

                  <hi>Goldwell</hi> is an ancient Mannor and Manſion in this Pariſh, which was for many Ages and Deſcents the Inheritance of the noble and illuſtrious Family of <hi>Goldwell,</hi> which in Times of an elder Aſpect, gave them both Seat and Sirname, out of which two learned Biſhops deſcended, <hi>Jam.

But alaſs! after this Mannor had been ſo long ſeated in the Patrimony of <hi>Goldwell,</hi> it was at length alienated (ſuch is the volatile and unſetled temper of all earthly Inheritances) not many years ſince by <hi>J.

                  <hi>Eaſture</hi> in this Pariſh, was the Seat of a Family which was known by that Sirname, and in ſeveral ancient Deeds, which are not bounded or limited with any Date, there is mention of <hi>John de Eaſture,</hi> who lived here in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third and <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt; after this Name was vaniſhed, the <hi>Apul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfields</hi> of <hi>Otterpley</hi> in <hi>Challock,</hi> a younger Branch of the <hi>Apulderfields</hi> of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancore,</hi> were inveſted in the Poſſeſſion; and of this Family was <hi>Henry de Apulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> in the fifty firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> third, and likewiſe Proprietary of this place; but when this Family reſolved into a Daughter and Heir called <hi>Iſabell,</hi> ſhe by matching with <hi>John Idelegh,</hi> who had a large Income about <hi>Mepham, Chalk,</hi> and <hi>Cobham,</hi> caſt it into the Inheritance of that Family, where it had not long remained, but a Viciſſitude like the former carryed it by <hi>Agnes</hi> the Female Heir of <hi>William Idelegh</hi> to <hi>Chriſtopher Ellenden,</hi> who was Maſter of a good Eſtate about <hi>Seaſalter</hi> and <hi>Damian Bleane,</hi> which Name not many years after ſhrunk into a Daughter and Heir likewiſe called <hi>Mary,</hi> deſcended from <hi>Thomas Ellenden,</hi> who was about the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh matched to

                  <hi>Youngs</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Chilham,</hi> which by Deeds of a very high gradation in time, which ſtep into the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, appears to be the Poſſeſſion of a Family of that Appellation; and when that was decayed and worn out at this Place, the <hi>Beverleys</hi> who were a Family which had been planted at <hi>Tancrey</hi> Iſland in <hi>Fordwich</hi> ever ſince the latter end of the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third were ingraffed in the Inheritance, and continued by an undiſſolved Chain of ſeveral Ages ſeated in the Proprietie of it, till <hi>George Beverley</hi> the laſt of this Name at this place in our Grandfathers Remembrance, demiſed his right in it by Sale to <hi>George Barley,</hi> where the Title found no long abode, for he paſſed away his Intereſt to <hi>Fleet,</hi> extracted from the <hi>Fleets</hi> of <hi>Fleet</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> who ſuddenly after alienated it to <hi>Shepheard,</hi> from which Family almoſt in our Remembrance it was by Purchaſe brought over to own the Signorie of Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs,</hi> who upon his deceaſe tranſmitted it to his eldeſt Son Mt. ....... <hi>Diggs</hi> Eſquire, in whom the preſent Proprietie of it is fixed.</p>

                  <hi>Dane Court</hi> is a fourth Mannor within the Limits of <hi>Chilham,</hi> not to be waved or declined in this preſent Survey: It was anciently the Patrimony of <hi>Thomas de Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winton</hi> of <hi>Welle</hi> in <hi>Littlebourne,</hi> and he held it, as appears by ancient Court Rolls, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, whoſe great Grandchild <hi>William Garwinton</hi> of <hi>Welle</hi> in the eleventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, dying without Iſſue, upon a ſerious debate and winnowing of Collateral Alliances, <hi>Joan</hi> Wife of <hi>Richard Haute</hi> was found to be his Couſin and Heir, and ſo this place became in her Right the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of this Family; but this mans Son called <hi>Richard,</hi> likewiſe not long after decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing without Iſſue male, <hi>Margerie</hi> his only Daughter, who was matched to <hi>Will.

               <p>There is a place in this Pariſh on the South-ſide of the River ſtretched out on a long green Hill, which the Common People (who bear the greateſt ſway in corrupting of Names) call <hi>Jelliberies</hi> Grave. The Hiſtorie it ſelf will evidence the original of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination. It was about this place that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> reſpited his farther remove or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance into the bowels of this Iſland, upon intelligence received that his Fleet riding in the road at <hi>Lymen</hi> not far diſtant, had been much afflicted and ſhattered by a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt; whereupon he returned, and left his Army for ten dayes, encamped upon the brow of this Hill, till he had new careen'd and rigg'd his Navy; but in his march from hence was ſo vigoriouſly encountered by the <hi>Britons,</hi> that he loſt with many others <hi>Leberius Durus</hi> Tribune and Marſhal of the Field, whoſe Obſequies being performed with ſolemnities anſwerable to the eminence of his Place, and Command, each Souldier as was then Cuſtomary, bringing a certain quantity of earth to improve his place of Sepulture into more note then ordinarie, cauſed it ſo much to exceed the proportion of others elſwhere; and from hence it aſſumed the name of <hi>Julaber,</hi> whom other vulgar heads, ignorant of the truth of the ſtory, have fancied to have been a Giant, and others of them have dreamed to have been ſome Enchanter or Witch.</p>
               <p>It is probable the <hi>Romanes</hi> built ſomething here at <hi>Chilham,</hi> for when Sir <hi>Dudly Diggs</hi> digged down the ruines of the old Caſtle, to make ſpace for the foundation of that exact and elegant Houſe which he there erected, there was the Baſis of a more ancient building diſcovered, and many Aeconomical veſſels of the <hi>Romane</hi> antique mode traced out in that place, beſides the Keeper of the Caſtle, which is yet preſerved, hath a Senate-Houſe adorned and furniſhed with Seats round about, ſhaped out of an excellent durable Stone.</p>

                  <hi>Hoad-court</hi> is, and always was, part of the Demeaſn of <hi>Eaſt-bridge</hi> Hoſpital, holding of the Maſter thereof. <hi>Eaſt-bridge,</hi> was formerly an Inn, for poor devout Pilgrims, who came to offer up their Viſits and Orizons to the ſhrine of <hi>Tho.

Bois</hi> Esq; a perſon who for his ingenious and candid Love to Literature may be juſtly ſaid to be worthy of better times, but fit for theſe; that is, though his Merit ſhould have been calculated for the beſt of days, yet it is made more eminent by his ſupport of Learning in the worſt.</p>

                  <hi>Cowden</hi> in the Hundreds of <hi>Somerden</hi> and <hi>Weſterham,</hi> did anciently with its revenue, ſupport the Colledge of <hi>Lingfield</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> till the publique diſſolution came and tore it off, and then it was by <hi>H.</hi> the eighth granted to <hi>H.</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> from whom it ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly after devolved by ſale to <hi>Wiskenden,</hi> whoſe Grandchild not many years ſince decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, left it divided between his two Sons, one of which hath lately alienated his Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety to <hi>Aſhdown,</hi> though the other proportion ſtill continues in the Name of <hi>Wickenden.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Moat</hi> is an eminent Seat in <hi>Cowden,</hi> which for many Generations confeſſed the Signory of a Family called <hi>Coſin</hi> or <hi>Coſins,</hi> as is evident from ſeveral Deeds of certain parcels of Land which relate to this Manſion, as the capital meſſuage which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, ſome by Sale, ſome by reſignation, from one <hi>Coſin</hi> to another. Whence this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was originally extracted, I cannot collect, becauſe the evidences of this place (from which I am to borrow my Intelligence) extend no higher then this Family, yet it is probable their firſt Cradle was in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> where in elder times they were eminent: for in the ſixteenth year of <hi>E.</hi> the ſecond, I find one <hi>Jo.

Sure I am, that after they had for many Deſcents been planted here, about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, it began to crumble away; for in the thirty ſecond year of that Prince, <hi>William Coſin</hi> by Deed paſſed it away to <hi>William Hextall, William Gainsford</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Gainsford,</hi> in the fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth; <hi>Hextall</hi> ſurrenders all his Intereſt here to <hi>William Gainsford</hi> Eſquire, ſo he is written in the Deed, and from him did it deſcend to <hi>Nicholas Gainsford,</hi> whom I find to be Juſtice of the Peace for <hi>Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Kent</hi> in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and from him is that Family ſucceſſively branched out, who are the inſtant proprietaries of this place.</p>

                  <hi>Ditton</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Larkefield,</hi> with its two Appendages <hi>Brampton</hi> and <hi>Sifleſton,</hi> were in times of a very high aſcent, the Patrimony of a Family called <hi>Brampton;</hi> the Book of <hi>Aid,</hi> (which makes a Recapitulation of the ancient owners, informs us. that anciently they were <hi>Bramptons,</hi> that is, in the Reign of King <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the third (as the Pipe-Rolls relating to both thoſe Kings times diſcover to us.)

And here the Title continued untill the forty third of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and then the Lord <hi>Bartholomew Burwaſh</hi> this mans Grandchild, conveyed them to Sir <hi>Walter de Paveley</hi> Knight of the Garter, and he, in the firſt year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, paſſed them away to <hi>Windleſor</hi> or <hi>Windſor:</hi> in which Family the Inheritance was placed, untill the fifteenth year of this Prince's Reign, and then they were conveyed to Sir <hi>Lewis Clifford;</hi> but in this Name they made no long abode neither.

                  <hi>Dodington</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Eyhorne,</hi> contains ſeverall places in it, of no contemptible Eſtimate.

But after this mans departure, I do not find that it owned this Family any farther, for this mans Sole Daughter and heir was matched to <hi>John de Bourne</hi> Son of <hi>John de Bourne,</hi> who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> the twenty ſecond, the twenty third, and twenty fourth years of <hi>Edw.</hi> the firſt, and after in the fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third: Certainly, this Family was in times of a very high Gradation, as eminent for Eſtate, as it was venerable for its Antiquitie; <hi>Henry de Bourne</hi> made a Purchaſe of Lands and Rents in <hi>Duddington,</hi> of <hi>Matilda</hi> the Daughter of <hi>John de Duddington,</hi> (as appears by a Fine levyed in the forty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third; and the above-mentioned <hi>John de Bourn</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at <hi>Bourne, Boxley Dodington,</hi> and other places, in the eighteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt; and from this <hi>John de Bourne,</hi> did Mr. <hi>William Bourne</hi> in an even ſtream of Deſcent iſſue forth, who almoſt in our Remembrance, paſſed away <hi>Sharsted-Court</hi> to Mr. <hi>Delawne</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe Son Mr. ....... <hi>Delawne</hi> is the inſtant Proprietarie of it.</p>

                  <hi>Ringleston</hi> is a ſecond place of note in this Pariſh: of which there is a Tradition, that it borrows its principal Appellation from a <hi>Ring</hi> and a <hi>Stone;</hi> which thoſe who were Tenants to this Mannor were to hold for ſuch a proportion of time, as an embleme of their acknowledged Homage and Subjection: But this is but a fabulous romance in the whole frame of it; the truth is, <hi>Ring,</hi> in <hi>Saxon,</hi> imports as much as Borough or Village, ſo that <hi>Ringleſton</hi> ſignifies no more but the Village-Stone, that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103337:74"/>is, ſome eminent Stone which was placed there, to ſignifie and diſcover the utmoſt extent and limits of the Borough.

                  <hi>Down-Court</hi> in <hi>Dodington,</hi> is an ancient Mannor, which in elder times owned the Signorie of <hi>Simon de Dodington,</hi> who flouriſhed here in the Reign of K. <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and was entituled likewiſe to the Patronage or Advouſon of the Church: but he determined in an only Daughter called <hi>Matilda de Dodington,</hi> who in the forty firſt of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third (as appears by a Fine levied in that year) paſſed away her Intereſt here to <hi>John de Bourne</hi> in which Family the Title many years after reſted, untill about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth it was conveyed to <hi>Dungate</hi> of <hi>Dungate-Street</hi> in <hi>Kingſdowne.</hi> And <hi>Andrew Dungate</hi> the laſt of this Name at this place, dying without Iſſue male, his ſole Daughter and Heir was marched to <hi>Killigrew,</hi> who likewiſe about the entrance of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, expired in two female Coheirs, whereof one was wedded to <hi>Roydon;</hi> the ſecond to <hi>Cowland.</hi> In <hi>Roydon</hi> The Pſſeſſion was but brief; for he, about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, alienated his Proportion to <hi>Adye,</hi> a Name deeply rooted in this Track, whoſe Succeſſor Mr. <hi>John Adye</hi> ſtill enjoyes the capitall Meſſuage or Manſion called <hi>Down-Court;</hi> but the Mannor it ſelf which accrued to <hi>John Cowland</hi> upon the Diviſion of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate was by his Will, made 1540. ordered to be ſold to diſcharge Debts and Legacies, and was according to the Tenure of the premiſes, not long after conveyed to <hi>Allen,</hi> Anceſtor to him who is the inſtant owner of it.</p>

For <hi>Jo. Petley</hi> reſolved into four Daughters and Coheirs, <hi>Agnes</hi> the eldeſt was matched to <hi>Jo. Manning,</hi> the ſecond was eſpouſed to <hi>Bird,</hi> the third was wedded to <hi>Caſinghurſt</hi> of <hi>Valous,</hi> and the fourth was married to <hi>Childrens:</hi> and upon partition of the Eſtate this Mannor fell to be the Inheritance of <hi>Manning,</hi> and in this Name for many years it remained conſtant, untill in our Fathers Remembrance, it went away by Sale to Sir <hi>Nicholas Carew</hi> of <hi>Beddington</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and his Son Sir <hi>Francis Carew,</hi> conveyed it to <hi>Ellis</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who not many years ſince alienated his Right in it to Colonel <hi>Richard Sandys,</hi> third Son of Sir <hi>Edward Sandys</hi> of <hi>Northbourne;</hi> but <hi>Down-Court</hi> was long before paſſed away by <hi>Manning</hi> to <hi>Palmer,</hi> which was ſeparated from the Mannor of <hi>Downe,</hi> and ſingly ſold by it ſelf.</p>

               <p>K. <hi>Henry</hi> ſixth made it his principal place of reſidence, and granted the Tenants of the Mannor of <hi>Eltham,</hi> a Charter of renovation of a Market in the ſeventeenth of his reign; which containeth more ample priviledges than any ſuch grant that yet I have ſeen, as will be likewiſe evident to thoſe who will peruſe the original Record of that year in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>K. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh ſet up the fair Front there, towards the Moat, and was uſually reſident there. I find in a Record, (in the Office of Arms) that he did uſually dine in the Hall, and all his Officers kept their Tables there; and at ſuch time as he created <hi>Stanley</hi> Baron <hi>Monteagle,</hi> by reaſon of ſome Infection then reigning in and near the City of <hi>London</hi> none were permitted to dine in the Kings Hall but the officers of Arms, who at the ſerving in the Kings ſecond Courſe of meat according to the Cuſtome, came and proclaimed the Kings ſtyle, and the ſtyle of the ſaid new Lord.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth built much at <hi>Greenwich</hi> with Bricks made here at <hi>Eltham,</hi> and then neglected this place; yet he lived here ſometime, and kept a royal Chriſtmaſs at this place, 1515. There is an ancient place in this Pariſh called <hi>Henleys,</hi> which in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, was a Marnor belonging to <hi>John de Henley,</hi> whoſe Houſe was moated about, the ſituation is yet extant below the Conduit-head; but he dying without Iſſue, it came by his guift to King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and was annexed unto the Mannor by <hi>William de Brantingham</hi> his Feoffee.</p>

               <p>A ſtrange and marvellous Accident happened at this place upon the fourth day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1585, in a Field which belongeth to Sir <hi>Percival Hart.</hi> Betimes in the morning, the ground began to ſink, ſo much, that three great Elme-Trees were ſuddenly ſwallowed into the Pit; the tops falling downward into the hole: And before ten of the Clock, they were ſo overwhelmed, that no part of them might be diſcerned, the Concave being ſuddenly filled with water: the Compaſs of the hole was about 80. yards, and ſo profound, that a ſounding line of fifty Fathoms, could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find or feel any bottome; ten yards diſtance from that place; there was another piece of ground ſunk in like manner, near the high-way, and ſo nigh a dwelling houſe, that the Inhabitants were greatly terrified therewith.</p>

Thus farre this Manuſcript. Who were the Poſſeſſors ſince, the Court-Rolls which do not aſcend very high, now in the Cuſtody of Mr. <hi>Hugben,</hi> diſcover: The firſt Family which they recite is <hi>Hales,</hi> and it remained in the Inheritance of that Name, till towards the end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then it was by Sale tranſported over to <hi>Manwood,</hi> who ſome few years after, diſpoſed of his Intereſt in it, by the ſame Alienation to Sir <hi>Rob. Lewknor,</hi> upon whoſe Deceaſe it devolved to his Son Mr. <hi>Hamon Lewknor</hi> Eſquire, who hath upon his Death during the Minority of his Son left the Poſſeſſion to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by his Widow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bowick</hi> is a ſixth place, which muſt now come within the pale of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.

                  <hi>Oxroad</hi> is a ſeventh Mannor in <hi>Elham.</hi> In a very old Court-Roll, now in the hands of Mr. <hi>Shetterden</hi> of <hi>Eltham,</hi> one <hi>John de Oxroad</hi> is repreſented to be the Poſſeſſor: and in others of a more modern Complexion, which bear date from <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and ſo downwards, untill the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, the <hi>Hinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys</hi> are diſcovered to us to be the Proprietaries of it, and then this Name was extinguiſhed in a Daughter and Heir: for <hi>Iſabell</hi> was the only Child of <hi>Thomas

                  <hi>Ladwood</hi> is an eighth Mannor in this Pariſh, written in old Evidences <hi>Lads<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> from whence we may ſpin out a more then probable Conjecture, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the erecting the houſe by <hi>Rolfe,</hi> it was a Wood belonging to <hi>Lad</hi> of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick;</hi> but for ſome hundreds of years, that is, fince the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, it hath conſtantly related to the Family of <hi>Rolfe,</hi> a Name which Mr. <hi>Thinne</hi> conjectures in a Pedigree which he collected of this Family, was contracted from the ancient German Name <hi>Rodolphus:</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> in his Kentiſh Perambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, mentions one <hi>Rolph</hi> a <hi>Saxon,</hi> who added much to the Caſtle of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> from whom it is not altogether improbable, this Family, which hath been ſo ancient at <hi>Elham,</hi> might extract their firſt original.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clavertie</hi> is the laſt place in this Pariſh, which may exact our mention: it did belong before the Suppreſſion to the Knights Hoſpitallers, and was one of thoſe places, in this Track, which was a Commaundry to the more general Seminary of this Order planted at <hi>Edwell.</hi> Upon the Diſſolution of this Order, here in <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, who condemned their Diſorder and Luxury, only to improve his own, like the <hi>Lapwing,</hi> who cries moſt when ſhe is fartheſt off from her Neſt, this was added to the Demeaſne of the Crown: and King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth granted it to <hi>Peter Heyman</hi> Eſquire, who was one of the Gentlemen off his Bedchamber, and great Grandfather to Sir <hi>Henry Hamon</hi> Baronet, who was the late Proprietarie of this Mannor of <hi>Claverty,</hi> a perſon to whom if I ſhould not affirm my ſelf ſignally and extraordinarily engaged, I deſerved to be repreſented to Poſterity under the darkeſt Complexion of Ingratitude.</p>

               <p>Before I leave this Diſcourſe of <hi>Eightam,</hi> I muſt inform the Reader of two things.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103337:78"/>Firſt that <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, in the ninth year of his Reign, granted Licence to <hi>Will. de Inge</hi> the Judge, to hold a Market here Weekly on the Monday, and a Fair yearly at <hi>Eightham,</hi> by the ſpace of three days, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vigill, the day of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and the day after. Secondly that the Family of <hi>James</hi> now Poſſeſſors of <hi>Eightam,</hi> were originally called <hi>Haſtrecht,</hi> as being Lords of a place of that Name neer <hi>Gouda,</hi> and were branched out from the ancient Family of <hi>Arkell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ex Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphis penes Do. Will.

Roger James,</hi> Son of <hi>Jacob van Haſtrecht,</hi> came out of <hi>Cleve,</hi> (whither his Anceſtor a yonger Son of the Lord of <hi>Haſtrecht,</hi> had been chaſed by one of the Lords of <hi>Holland,</hi> becauſe his Father, who likewiſe was forced to <hi>Drunen</hi> neer <hi>Hueſden,</hi> by that Count, had been an eager Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan of his enemy, the Biſhop of <hi>Vtretcht</hi>) into <hi>England,</hi> about the beginning of <hi>Hen.</hi> the eighth, and being called after the <hi>Belgick</hi> mode, <hi>Roger Jacobs,</hi> the Engliſh by a more ſoft and gentle pronunciation, filed off the roughneſſe of the Accent and by melting it into a more narrow Volume, contracted it into <hi>James.</hi> By marriage, the Family of <hi>Haeſtrecht</hi> and <hi>Arkell</hi> above mentioned, are allyed to the eminent Houſe of <hi>Waſſenaer,</hi> iſſued out from the ancient Counts of <hi>Holland,</hi> as likewiſe to the Family of <hi>Waermont</hi> neer <hi>Leyden,</hi> who matched with the Heir of <hi>Haſtrecht</hi> of <hi>Drunen,</hi> (where this Family had for many Deſcents been planted, ever ſince their firſt expulſion thither, by the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi>) who was Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, and <hi>Droſart</hi> of <hi>Breda,</hi> when it was under the Government and Scepter of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Cleres</hi> is the ſecond place of Note in this Pariſh; it was formerly called <hi>Aldham,</hi> as being for many years the Patrimony of that Family, the laſt of which was Sir <hi>Tho. de Aldham,</hi> who reſolved into three Female Coheirs: ....... matched to <hi>Newborough</hi> of the County of <hi>Dorſett, Margery</hi> matched to <hi>Martin de Pecham,</hi> and <hi>Iſolda</hi> wedded to <hi>John St. Clere.</hi> Upon the partition of his patrimony, this place was, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Ed.</hi> the third, annexed to the Inheritance of St. <hi>Clere,</hi> and ſo it becamein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure of Time ſtyled <hi>Aldham St. Cleres:</hi> but Cuſtome and vulgar Uſe did not long after file off the firſt Appellation, ſo that it hath for diverſe Generations, been ſtyled ſingly St. <hi>Cleres. Iſolda St. Clere</hi> Widow of this <hi>John,</hi> did, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third pay reſpective Aid, for her Lands at <hi>Eightham,</hi> at the making the Black Prince Knight. And in this Family did the Stream of Poſſeſſion carry down the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this place, till towards the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and then it was ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from this Name and ſetled in <hi>Richard Empſon,</hi> the grand Projector, who had wire-drawn, by his cloſe and dextrous Artifices, the Treaſure of the Kingdome into ſuch ſubtile Threads, as he had almoſt wound it all into the Kings Exchequer: But he being convicted of Felony for his many Exceſſes, in the firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, this was confiſcated to the Crown, and there it was not many years after by that Prince, granted to Sir <hi>Thomas Bullen</hi> Knight of the Garter, and created Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> in the year 1529, whoſe infortunate Son <hi>George</hi> Viſcount <hi>Rochford,</hi> being blaſted with the black Aſperſion of Treaſon, which was multiplyed and inforced to that Bulke, that the weight of it ſunk him upon a Bloody and untimely Scaffold, and then this Mannor upon the Death of his Father, which was in the thirtyeth year of <hi>Hen.</hi> the eighth, was ſeiſed on by the Crown, as being ſetled before on him and his Heirs male, of whom this unhappy Lord was the laſt: Some few years after, it was by Royall Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the aboveſaid Prince, made the Patrimony of <hi>George Moulton</hi> Eſquire, of <hi>Moulton</hi> in <hi>Hadloe,</hi> a Man of high Repute in thoſe Times, and much intereſſed in the Favour of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: whoſe Grandchild <hi>Robert Moulton</hi> Eſquire, almoſt in Times within the pale of our Remembrance, alienated his Right in it to Sir <hi>John Syd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> Knight and Baronet, who hath upon the old Foundation erected that magnificent Pile, which for the Grandeur, Elegance, and Majeſtick Aſpect it carryes to the publick View, ſurrenders a Priority, but to few Structures in this County.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moat</hi> is the third and laſt place which ſummons our Remembrance. It was in elder Times the Inheritance of <hi>Ivo de Haut,</hi> who flouriſhed in the Reign of King <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the third: his Grandchild was <hi>Henry de Haut,</hi> who held this Mannor at his Deceaſe, which was in the forty fourth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third,

Afterwards, I find that <hi>Richard Haut</hi> Grandchild to this Man was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> the eighteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth: and again in the twenty ſecond year of the aboveſaid Prince, he was ſecond Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Sir <hi>William Haut</hi> of <hi>Hautsbourne,</hi> who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> in the ſixth yeer of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and great Uncle to Sir <hi>William Haut.</hi> But this <hi>Richard Haut,</hi> having with <hi>John Fogge, John Guldford</hi> Eſquire, <hi>John Darell</hi> Eſquire, <hi>James Horne</hi> of <hi>Weſtwell, William Clifford, Reginald Pimpe, John Pimpe,</hi> and <hi>Edward Poynings</hi> of <hi>Marſham</hi> or <hi>Merſham,</hi> embarked himſelf in the Deſigns of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>

                  <hi>Evington Court</hi> is an ancient Seat in <hi>Elmeſted,</hi> which was the Inheritance of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of that Sirname, who bare a <hi>Feſſe</hi> between three <hi>Steel Burgonets</hi> for their Coat Armour: and in a Book coppied out from old Deeds and digeſted into a juſt Volume, by <hi>William Glover Somerſett Herald,</hi> and now in my Cuſtody, there is the Copy of an old Deed without date, wherein <hi>William Fitz-Neal,</hi> called in Latin <hi>Filius Nigelli,</hi> does paſſe over ſome Land to <hi>Ruallo de Valoigns,</hi> which is fortified by the appendant
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103337:79"/>Teſtimony of one <hi>Robert de Evington,</hi> who was Anceſtor to the <hi>Evingtons</hi> of <hi>Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,</hi> of whom there is mention in the Deeds of this place, in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> the third, and <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt.

And to juſtifie the Truth of this their Extraction, in the <hi>Leiger</hi> Book of <hi>Horton</hi>-Priory, there is mention of one <hi>John le Gay</hi> who was a Benefactor to their Houſe, and though they are called at this day, only, without the Addition, <hi>Gay;</hi> yet this hath happened by Diſuſe and Intermiſſion, by not adding it in their Cuſtomary writing and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing it to their Name. But to proceed: <hi>Evington Court</hi> though it was not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally erected by this Family, yet certainly it was much inforced by Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and additionall Building; for diverſe places of the Houſe are in Relation to the Name, adorned with Noſe-Gays. In Concluſion, after it had owned many of this Name of no vulgar Ranck for its Proprietaries, it was, about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, by <hi>Chriſtopher Gay,</hi> alienated to <hi>John Honywood</hi> Eſquire, of the eldeſt Family of the <hi>Honywoods;</hi> from whom in a direct Line, <hi>Edward Honywood</hi> Eſquire, Son and Heir of Sir <hi>John Honywood,</hi> lately deceaſed, is extracted, and is now inveſted in the Poſſeſſion of this place.</p>

                  <hi>Bedenwell</hi> in this Pariſh had formerly the Repute of a Mannor, when it was the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a Family called <hi>Boreford</hi> or more vulgarly <hi>Burford: Roſe de Burford</hi> held it at her Death, which was in the third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſe. Num.</hi> 52. And afterwards I find <hi>James de Burford</hi> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at <hi>Bedenwell</hi> in <hi>Erith,</hi> in the thirty fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. After this Family was expired, which was before the end of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, it came to be the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Draper,</hi> deſcended from an ancient Family of that Name in the County of <hi>Notingham,</hi> who concluded in a Female Heir. For <hi>William Killom</hi> matched with the ſole Daughter of <hi>John Draper,</hi> by whom he obtained <hi>Bedenwell;</hi> but with this Proviſo that he ſhould change his Name to <hi>Draper,</hi> which hath been ever ſince both by <hi>Draper</hi> of <hi>Crayford,</hi> and <hi>Draper</hi> of <hi>Hering-Hill</hi> in <hi>Erith</hi> punctually performed. But ſince this ſolemne Stipulation, <hi>Bedenwell</hi> in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall peices hath been ſold to <hi>Turner, Gainsford</hi> of <hi>Crowherſt</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> (who not many years ſince, alienated his Proportion to <hi>Cholmeley</hi>) and others; ſo that being thus broken into Fragments, it hath now loſt the eſtimate of a Mannor, and is to be entombed in Silence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hering-Hill</hi> is a place not to be forgotten, having been in elder Times the Reſidence of a Family called <hi>Abell.</hi> The firſt whom I find repreſented to us, under a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of eſtimate, was Sir <hi>John Abell,</hi> who was in the Liſt of the Kentiſh Knights, which were Aſſiſtant to King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, at his Siege of <hi>Carlaverock</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; John Abell</hi> his Succeſſor was a Judge (as is manifeſt by the patent Rolls, of the <hi>Tower</hi>) in the eighth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and it is very probable, that it was either this <hi>John Abell</hi> or his Father, that obtained a Charter of Free-warren to the Mannor of <hi>Catford</hi> in <hi>Lewſham</hi> (which was after ſold to <hi>William de Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi>) in the twenty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt. In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth: I find, by the Regiſters of the Crown Office, one <hi>Edward Abell</hi> to have been in Commiſſion for the Peace, and he lyes enter'd in <hi>Erith</hi> Church, not in the Coemitery or Church-yard: though I confeſſe, upon a large ſquare Plate of Wood, there is a Regiſter of thoſe accurately enrolled, who were Poſſeſſors of <hi>Hering-Hill,</hi> from <hi>John Abell</hi> the Judge, down to another <hi>John Abell</hi> who dyed poſſeſt of it about the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but the date is ſo violated by Time and the Impreſſion of the injurious Elements, that it is hardly viſible, much leſſe intelligible; the laſt of this Family at this place, was <hi>John Abell,</hi> who about the year 1611, joyning with his Father <hi>Samuell Abell,</hi> alienated his Concernment here to Mr. <hi>William Draper,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor Mr..... <hi>Draper,</hi> now of the County of <hi>Oxford,</hi> is the inſtant Proprietary of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leſnes Abby</hi> was founded by <hi>Richard de Lucy,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>H.</hi> the ſecond, in the year 1179 and dedicated to St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Martyr, the Saint of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who as he had been above the Kings Will on earth, was now above his Faith in Heaven, being after his, but early Canonization, grown into ſuch Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Eſtimate, that Oriſons and Prayers, Shrines, and Altars, Abbyes and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, were offered up to his Name, of which this was none of the leaſt, being a Houſe of black Canons, or Canons of St. <hi>Auguſtins.</hi> This <hi>Richard de Lucy</hi> the Founder, was Son of <hi>Richard,</hi> who was Son of <hi>Roger de Chilham,</hi> and he was Son of <hi>Fulbert de Dover,</hi> who entred into <hi>England</hi> with <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, and changed his Name of <hi>Lucy</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> (of which, firſt, there is not only a Signiory or Lordſhip, but likewiſe a Family at this inſtant remaining in <hi>France</hi>) becauſe he was one of thoſe eight, to whom certain Knights-Fees were aſſigned by <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, to be Aſſiſtant to <hi>John de Fiennes,</hi> in the Guard of <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle; thus much for his Extraction. Now for his Dignity, he was not only Lord Chief Juſtice, but likewiſe Protector of <hi>England,</hi> in the twelfth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, in his Abſence in <hi>France,</hi> which great Office he managed with ſo much Fidelity, Prudence, and Magnanimity, that when the Earl of <hi>Boloign</hi> invaded this Iſland, in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103337:81"/>the thirteenth year of the aboveſaid Prince, he was forced to retire with Shame Confuſion, and Loſſe: which Action muſt certainly have improved his Name to a very high Eſtimate, in the Opinion of thoſe Times. Yet notwithſtanding he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted himſelf of that Pomp and Pageantry, theſe great Offices had made him glitter with (which Conqueſt, that he made upon himſelf within, was of more Importance, then any he could have atchieved without) and clouded himſelf in a Monks Cowle, and became the Prior to that Covent, he himſelf had erected, and there likewiſe found his place of Sepulture: And it is probable, that thoſe Coffins, with Pourtraictures inſculped, which were diſcovered in a Grotto or Vault, upon the breaking down the Foundation of this Houſe, in the Government of King <hi>James,</hi> were the Exchequers which treaſured up, not only the Reliques of this Sir <hi>Richard de Lucy,</hi> but likewiſe the remains of others of the ſame Family: But to proceed, the Prior of this place was in that Repute, that it was cuſtomary for him (as the Records of the Church of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> tell us) to have his Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction into this place, either by the Biſhop immediately, or elſe by ſome Proxie, who repreſented the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s Perſon. And in this State it continued, untill Cardinall <hi>Wolſey</hi> laid the Foundation of his eminent Colledge of <hi>Chriſtchurch</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and thenwith the conſent of the preſent Abbot, in the year 1525, it was ſuppreſt, and the Revenue of this Cloiſter, being found in the Hands of the aboveſaid Cardinal at his Death, was by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, united to the Income of the Crown, where it dwelt, untill it was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>William Brereton</hi> Eſquire, who being engaged in the fatall Buſineſs of <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine Howard,</hi> was attainted, and executed, upon whoſe Tragedy, it returned to the Crown; and was in the thirty eighth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, granted to Sir <hi>Ralph Sadler;</hi> and he not long after paſſed it away to Mr. <hi>Henry Cook;</hi> in whoſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, the Poſſeſſion was reſident, untill almoſt our Remembrance, and then it was conveyed to Sir <hi>Thomas Gainsford</hi> of <hi>Crowherſt</hi> in <hi>Surrey;</hi> who not many years ſince, demiſed his Right in it to Mr. <hi>Haws</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> who dying lately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, hath ſetled it for ever, on the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> in <hi>Smithfield.</hi>

               <p>In the ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Lord <hi>Badeleſmer,</hi> obtained the Grant of a Market to <hi>Erith,</hi> on the Thurſday, and a three Days Fair at St. <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and another three Days Fair, the Monday, Tueſday, and Wedneſday in Whitſon Week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leſnes,</hi> had by the Mediation of <hi>William de Wilton,</hi> a Grant of a Market, procured to be obſerved there on the Thurſday, and a Fair to continue yearly the Eve, <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Judes</hi> Day, and three Days after, as is manifeſt, <hi>Pat.</hi> 41. <hi>Henrici tertii Memb.</hi> 48.</p>

                  <hi>Eſtling</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> gave Sirname to a Family, who had here an eminent Manſion called <hi>Northcourt,</hi> the laſt of which Family, was <hi>Ralph de Eſtling,</hi> whoſe Daughter and Heir <hi>Alice de Eſtling,</hi> about the Beginning of <hi>Ed.</hi> the firſt, was matched to <hi>Fulke de Peyforer, Cuſtos</hi> of the Fleet, and Weſtminſter in <hi>London,</hi> who in her Right became Lord of this place, and in the thirty ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, to inforce his Intereſt here, obtained a Charter of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warren to this place; and in this Family did it reſide, untill the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and then was <hi>Northcourt, Denton,</hi> and <hi>Plomford,</hi> Mannors, which came along to <hi>Peyforer</hi> with <hi>Northcourt,</hi> were ſold away to <hi>Roger</hi> Lord <hi>Leybourn;</hi> and his Widow <hi>Juliana de Leybourn</hi> held them at her Deceaſe, which was in the firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot.

And after her Deceaſe, they devolved to <hi>John de Haſtings,</hi> a Kinſman of <hi>Lawrence de Haſtings</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> who was the firſt Husband of her Daughter and Heir <hi>Juliana de Leybourn;</hi> after his Deceaſe remarried to <hi>William de Clinton</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> who in her Right was likewiſe poſſeſt of them, but likewiſe Deceaſed without any Iſſue by her, in the twenty eighth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, after whoſe Death, it is more then probable, ſhe continued a Widow. For in the Inquiſition taken in the forty third year of <hi>Ed.</hi> the third, ſhe is ſtyled <hi>Comitiſſa de Huntington,</hi> and was found upon a ſerious win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowing, both of her Direct and collaterall Alliances, to have no Heirs that could directly pretend to the Title, ſo that her Eſtate here laps'd to the Crown, and King
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103337:81"/>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the third, in the fiftieth year of his Rule, granted the Mannors of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, Denton,</hi> and <hi>Plomford,</hi> to the Abby of St. <hi>Mary Grace</hi> on <hi>Tower Hill,</hi> where they reſted untill the Diſſolution: and then King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, granted them to Sir <hi>Thomas Cheyney</hi> one of his Privy Councel, whoſe laviſh and unthrifty Son <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cheyney,</hi> after his Eſtate mouldered away by Retail in the eighth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> paſſed them away to <hi>Martin James</hi> Eſquire, whoſe great Grandchild, Mr. <hi>Walter James,</hi> is at this inſtant the indiſputable Proprietary of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Huntingfield</hi> in <hi>Eſtling,</hi> gave Sirname to that illuſtrious Family of <hi>Huntingfield,</hi> and ſtands a Monument to this Day, to inforce and perpetuate its Memory to Poſterity, though the Name be long ſince extinguiſhed, and gon out in two Daughters and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs, being entombed in <hi>Coupledick</hi> and <hi>Norwich.</hi> The capital Seat of this Family, was at <hi>Weſt-Wickham,</hi> on the Skirts of <hi>Surrey,</hi> where I ſhall make a more ample men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them: but they had other parcels of Land, which lay ſcattered in the ſeverall Pariſhes of <hi>Northſleet, Mepham, Ludsdown, Cobham</hi> and other places, and it is probable this Family was poſſeſt of an Eſtate likewiſe in <hi>Somerſetſhire.</hi> For in Mr. <hi>Biſhe,</hi> late prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Notes upon <hi>Upton,</hi> one <hi>Walter de Huntingfield,</hi> is repreſented as Teſte to that memorable Compact, which bears Date the twenty eighth of Aprill, in the forty ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and was made between <hi>Henry de Ferneburgh,</hi> and the Abbot and Covent of <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> to defend the Lands of the aboveſaid Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, againſt all the Claim or Pretence, of the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> with the Dean and Canons of the ſame place, or any of their Champions; and certainly, this <hi>Walter de Huntingfield,</hi> is he, who is mentioned, to have paid reſpective Aid, in the Book called <hi>Teſta de Neviſt,</hi> for much Land which he held in <hi>Kent,</hi> at the Marriage of <hi>Iſab.</hi> the Kings Siſter, in the twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. The laſt of this Family who was poſſeſſor of this Mannor was Sir <hi>John Huntingfield,</hi> who was ſummoned to ſit as a Baron in Parliament, in the thirty ſixth year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third; and he paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Sim. de Burley,</hi> in whom it was reſident, until the tenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond; and then he being by Parliament convicted of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for ſeeking in a Time, when too much Loyalty was ruinous, to ſupport the ſhaking Prerogative of his Prince, againſt the Aſſaults and Impreſſions made upon it, by ſome of the ambitious Nobility; This Mannor with <hi>Northcourt,</hi> likewiſe in this Pariſh, which was granted to him upon the Deceaſe of <hi>Juliana</hi> Counteſſe of <hi>Huntington,</hi> eſcheated to the Crown, and there made its aboad, untill the twenty firſt of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and then that Prince, ſetled it by a new Grant, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>Pat.</hi> 1. <hi>An.</hi> 21. <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. <hi>Memb.</hi> 35. <hi>Pars tertia.</hi> On the Dean and Canons of St. <hi>Stephens</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and continued chained to their Revenue, untill the Link was by the general Diſſolution of Religious Gonventions, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, untied and broken, and then being caſt into the Demeaſne of the Crown, it was in the thirty fifth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, granted to <hi>Alured Randolph,</hi> and <hi>John Guldford</hi> Eſquires, and they not long after, conveyed their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in it by Sale to Sir <hi>Thomas Moil,</hi> from whom the ſame Fatality in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, carried it away, and tranſplanted it into <hi>John Wild</hi> Eſquire: and he not long after, tranſmitted his Concernment in it to <hi>Gates,</hi> and from this Name, the Propriety about the Beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was by the Viciſſitude of Sale, conveyed to <hi>Martin James</hi> Eſquire, Examiner of the Chancery, from whom the Title by deſcendant Right is flowed down to his great Granchild, Mr. <hi>Walt.

                  <hi>Diven Arnold</hi> is a third place of mark, in <hi>Eſtling.</hi> It is called ſo, becauſe it was in Ages of a very venerable Inſcription; the Inheritance of a Family called <hi>Dive,</hi> and it had the Addition of <hi>Arnold,</hi> becauſe one <hi>Arnoldus de Dive</hi> poſſeſt it, and is often mentioned in Deeds without date, and was Teſte to a Deed, whereby <hi>John de Valoigns,</hi> does convey Lands to <hi>Robert de Dive,</hi> Prior of the Hoſpiral of St. <hi>Johns</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which is juſtified by a fine levyed between the ſaid <hi>John</hi> and this <hi>Robert,</hi> in the ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third.

               <p>There was an ancient Tradition that that Altar-Tomb, which was placed at the Eaſt-end of the little Chappel, which belonged to <hi>Eaſtry Court,</hi> was the Sepulchre wherein the Reliques of the two Princes (mentioned before, to have been murdered,) were enſhrined: nay it went farther and did affirm that there was a Light hovered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly about that Tomb, as if the Clearneſſe of the Innocence of thoſe who ſlumbered under that Repoſitory, could not have been manifeſted better, then by the Beams of ſuch a perpetuate Itradation.</p>

                  <hi>Heronden</hi> in this Pariſh, was the Seat of a Family known by that Sirname, who bare for his Coat Armour a <hi>Heron</hi> with one <hi>Tallon</hi> erected, and gaping for Breath. One of this Family lay buryed neer the Chancel, in the Time of <hi>Robert Glover Somerſet</hi>-Herald, with his Pourtraicture and Coat of Arms in Braſſe affixed to the Tombſtone: both which by the rude Hand of ſome ſacrilegious Perſon, are now torn away; yet is the Coat-ſtill extant in very old Rolls and Regiſters, in the Heralds Office, where the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is called <hi>Heronden</hi> of <hi>Heronden.</hi> Nor is the Name leſſe ancient, as appears by Deeds which commence from the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, which related then to this Houſe and Name. In the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, this Family determined in a Female Heir, who was matched to <hi>Boteler</hi> of <hi>Botelers</hi> Fleet in <hi>Aſh,</hi> and ſhe annexed this Place to the Patrimony of this Family, in which Name the Title of this Place, hath been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince ſucceſſively laid up.</p>

                  <hi>Ewell</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Bewsborough,</hi> was a principal Manſion of the Knights Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers, to which much Land was united, both in this Track, and in <hi>Romney Merſh,</hi> where they held the Mannors of <hi>Hony-Child</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-Bridge,</hi> as appears by the Book called <hi>Liber de Terris Templariorum,</hi> collected in the year 1130, and kept in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer. They were founded in the year 1118, in manner following. Cetrain Knights obliged themſelves by Vow, in the Hands of the Hands of the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſerve <hi>Chriſt</hi> after the mannor of Regular Cannons, in Chaſtiry and Obedience, renouncing their own Wills for ever: they likewiſe profeſſed to defend the Croſſe and Sepulcher of our Saviour from the Eruptions of Infidels, and to ſecure the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103337:82"/>high-ways for the Indempnity of Pilgrims, from the Ambuſhes of Free-booters, that they might more freely viſit the place of our Saviours Agony and Crucifixion. They were called Templers, either from their Vow to defend the Temple, or elſe, from thoſe Lodgings which were aſſigned them, neer that place, by <hi>Baldwin</hi> the fourth King of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This order in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, was totally ſuppreſt throughout Chriſtendome. The Crimes alledged againſt them, were Pride, Covetouſneſſe, for did and unaturall Uncleanneſſe, and laſtly private Colluſions and Treaties with Infidels, which tended to the Subverſion of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Cauſe in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> all which they ſolemnly renownced at their Death, which beſt interprets their Innocence to future Times: for certainly it was impoſſible, that an Order which had tyed themſelves up, upon their Inſtitution, within the Limitations of ſo ſtrict a Vow, could univerſally at one Time, and in all places of the World where they were eſtabliſhed, degenerate into thoſe black, horrid and prodigious Crimes, wherewith their Enemies beſpattered them. But indeed thoſe who have fathomed the Cauſe of this their totall Abolition, find, that they were warping with ſome Compliance too eagerly to a Combination with the Emperour, who was then in Conteſt with the Pope, about vindicating his temporal power in <hi>Italy,</hi> and elſe-where, from the unjuſt enchroachments made upon it by that See. Which his Holyneſs deſcrying, wrapt them up in thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Crimes, as the Roman Perſecutors did the ancient Chriſtians, in the skins of Beaſts, that they might more eaſily be devoured. Upon this their Diſſolution, their Houſe here at <hi>Temple Ewell,</hi> was given to the Knights of St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> an Order rather reſtored then inſtituted by one <hi>Girardus,</hi> whoſe Vow was almoſt coincident in all the Ingredients of it, with that of the Knights Templers. And in their Demeaſne did this place lye wound up, untill the finall Diſſolution, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; and then being linked to the Revenue of the Crown it was fixed there untill the ſixth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and then it was granted to <hi>William Cavendiſh</hi> Eſquire, and he the ſame year conveyed it to <hi>Chriſtopher Sackvill,</hi> and <hi>Winefrid</hi> his Wife, who about the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> alienated it to <hi>John D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Faukham</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Acſtane,</hi> was the Seat, and gave the Sirname to an ancient Family called <hi>Faukham.</hi> The firſt whom I find upon Record is <hi>Walle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran de Faukham,</hi> who flouriſhed here in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, as appears by the Book called <hi>Nova Feoffamenta,</hi> taken in that Princes Reign, and kept in the Exchequer. Afterwards in Times of a more modern date it acknowledged the Signory of the Lord <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> Baron of <hi>Ferneborough,</hi> and <hi>Otho de Grandiſon,</hi> is ſaid, in the Book of <hi>Aid,</hi> with <hi>Gilbert de Kirkbie,</hi> to have held one Knights Fee in <hi>Faukham</hi> of the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> which <hi>Roſe de Faukham</hi> and <hi>William de St. Clere</hi> of <hi>Ford</hi> in <hi>Wrotham</hi> formerly held, and this <hi>Otho</hi> Lord <hi>Grandiſon</hi> held it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 41. And left it to his Son <hi>Thomas Grandiſon,</hi> who dyed without Iſſue in the forty ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 36. So that his Eſtate here and in other places, was divided between his Siſters and Coheirs; whereof this, came to be poſſeſt by Sir <hi>John Northwood,</hi> in Right of <hi>Agnes</hi> one of his Siſters, from whom by a conſtant Line of Succeſſion, it was guided down to his Son Sir <hi>Roger Northwood,</hi> who was extinguiſhed in a Female Heir called <hi>Albina Northwood,</hi> matched to <hi>John Diggs</hi> of <hi>Diggs Court</hi> in <hi>Berham</hi> Eſquire: who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and ſo in her Right, this Mannor devolved to this Family, and lay couched in their Eſtate until the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; and then it was paſſed away to <hi>Barham</hi> of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-Court</hi> in <hi>Teſton.</hi> In which Name the Propriety had not been long reſident, when <hi>Thomas Barham</hi> Eſquire, concluded in a Daughter and Heir called <hi>Ann,</hi> who was eſpouſed to Sir <hi>Oliver Boteler,</hi> who caſt this into his Revenue, from whom it is now come down to Sir <hi>Oliver Boteler</hi> Baronet, only Son of Sir <hi>William Boteler,</hi> ſlain at <hi>Cropready</hi> Bridge, in aſſerting the Royall Quarrell.</p>

                  <hi>Frendsbury</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Shamell,</hi> hath ſeverall places in it worthy of our Cogniſance. The firſt is <hi>Eſlingham,</hi> which was given to the Church of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> in <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> by <hi>Kenulfus</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> as the Book called <hi>Textus Roffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> informs me: But by the Regiſters of that Church, I find that <hi>John de St. Clere,</hi> held it in Leaſe of the Covent, about the ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; and after him a Family called <hi>Neal,</hi> who had large Poſſeſſions about <hi>Higham,</hi> were Leſſees to the Cloiſter. In the ſixth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, I find <hi>John Rykeld</hi> held it, and kept his Shrievalty at this place: after him a Family called <hi>Frogenhall,</hi> was by Right of Leaſe in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, poſſeſt of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103337:84"/>it, but upon the Suppreſſion of this Monaſtery of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> in the twenty ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, this Mannor was found to be Leaſe to <hi>Audley</hi> and <hi>Fiſher;</hi> and then the Fee-ſimple in Reverſion was granted to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> who, being by the Malice of his Enemies, who had raiſed all their Black Engines of Miſchief upon him, aſperſed with the Calumnious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of high Treaſon, was attainted in the thirty ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and made a Peace-offering to the Fury of his irreconcileable Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; then this, by Eſcheat, returns back to the Crown; after which that Prince, by his Royall Conceſſion, makes it the Inheritance, of Sir <hi>Will. Drury</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,</hi> in which Family it remained, untill Times of our Knowledge and Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and then the Intereſt was by Sale, tranſlated into <hi>Henry Clerk</hi> Eſquire, Serjeant at Law, and late Recorder of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> from whom it is now come down to his Son and Heir <hi>Francis Clerk</hi> Eſquire, collaterally deſcended from that eminent Souldier Sir <hi>John Clerk</hi> of <hi>Willoughby</hi> in <hi>Warwick-ſhire,</hi> who took <hi>Lewis de Orleans</hi> Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> Priſoner, in that memorable Encounter commenced between <hi>Bomy</hi> and <hi>Spours,</hi> Villages not far diſtant from <hi>Terowan</hi> or <hi>Terwin,</hi> in the fifth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, which was Signally teſtified by that Prince, when by his Favour and Command, there was annexed this Augmentation to his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Coat <hi>viz,</hi> upon a <hi>Canton Azure</hi> a <hi>Demy Ram</hi> Saliant Argent, armed <hi>Or,</hi> between two <hi>Flower de Lis</hi> of the laſt, over all a <hi>Batton</hi> or <hi>Truncheon</hi> (which intimates to us, that that Captive-Duke, was one of the Marſhalls of <hi>France</hi>) <hi>Dexterways</hi> in <hi>Bend,</hi> of the Second.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chaddington</hi> is a ſecond place of Account, and repreſents to our Remembrance, the Lords <hi>Cobham,</hi> who were in elder Times, Lords of the Fee. <hi>John de Cobham</hi> dyed ſeiſed of it, in the twenty eighth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 42. And from this <hi>John,</hi> did it ſucceſſively flow down to <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> who was attainted in the firſt year of King <hi>James,</hi> upon whoſe Conviction, this Mannor eſcheated to the Crown; and that Prince ſome few years after, granted it to his Kinſman <hi>Lodowick</hi> Duke of <hi>Lenox;</hi> but he dying without Iſſue, it deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to his Nephew <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> lately deceaſed, whoſe Dutcheſſe Dowager during the Minority of the Duke, her Son, holds the preſent enjoyment of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goddington</hi> is a third place, which calls for our Conſideration: It was parcel of the Patrimony of the ancient Family of <hi>Charles. Robert Charles,</hi> who was poſſeſt of Land about <hi>Hilden</hi> in <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and was Bailiff of the Forreſt or Chaſe there to <hi>Robert de Clare</hi> Earl of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> was ſeiſed of it at his Death, which was in the twenty ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 74. From whom it devolved to <hi>Nicholas Charles,</hi> who dying without Iſſue in the eleventh year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Alice</hi> one of his Siſters and Coheirs brought this to be the Inheritance of <hi>William Snaith,</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> in the ninth year of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, deſcended from <hi>William de Snaith,</hi> who was made Chancellor of the Kings Exchequer, during Pleaſure, in the fifty fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third: but this Family likewiſe going out in a Daughter and Heir, ſhe by matching with <hi>Watton,</hi> whoſe Anceſtor held Lands at <hi>Rydley</hi> nere <hi>Aſh,</hi> in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, annexed it to the Incom of that Family, in which Name the Title hath ever ſince, by an even and permanent Succeſſion reſided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wainſcot</hi> is the laſt place of any Eminence. It was a Branch which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted upon that Demeaſne which fell under the Signiory of the <hi>Colepepers</hi> of <hi>Alresford. Walter Colepeper</hi> of <hi>Preſton</hi> in that Pariſh, held it at his Death, which was in the firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 80. And into the Patrimony of this Family did the Right of it, by a Succeſſion of many Deſcents, even ſeem to have bin riveted, having continued conſtant to this Name, from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned <hi>Walter Colepeper,</hi> untill the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and then it was alienated to <hi>Randolph,,</hi> from which Family in Times which were within the Circle of our Fathers Remembrance it paſſed away by Sale to <hi>Somers,</hi> deſcended from <hi>William Somer,</hi> Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth who held much Land in the Hundred of <hi>Hoo,</hi> whoſe Son not many years ſince paſſed it away, to Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter.</hi>

                  <hi>Frenſted</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Eyhorne,</hi> was honored anciently, by being parcel of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of the noble Family of <hi>Crombwell,</hi> written ſo in elder Times, though ſince a ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pronunciation hath been quilted into the Name, ſo that in Times of a more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Aſpect, it hath been written <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who had here a Seat called now <hi>Meriam Court,</hi> but in elder Orthography written <hi>Mereham</hi> Court. The firſt of this Family whom I find poſſeſt of it, was <hi>John de Crombwell,</hi> who in the eighth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, as Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> in his Gloſſary, in the Word <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neretus,</hi> cites the Record out of the Office of the <hi>Pell,</hi> was written <hi>Banneret.</hi> Now what theſe <hi>Bannerets</hi> were, I ſhall briefly unfold: they were formerly called <hi>Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illiferi,</hi> becauſe their Inveſtiture anciently, was, by delivering to them a <hi>Guidon,</hi> which was nothing but a <hi>Pennon</hi> cut off at the end, which before flowed out into an acute Angle, and now was faſhioned and compoſed into a Square. And as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, thirteen Knights Fees, did in the vulgar Eſtimate, make up a Tenure <hi>per Baroniam;</hi> ſo did ten Knights Fees compoſe a <hi>Banneret,</hi> out of which he was (whenſoever the Affairs of the Prince did require) to bring into the Field twelve or ſixteen Chevaliers or Horſemen, and thoſe Perſons of no cheap or inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Account, but ſuch as could (as Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> notes, <hi>ex Praediis &amp; Peculio proprio</hi>) out of their own Patrimony, Equipp, Horſe and furniture of Armes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the Service they were to be embarked in.</p>
               <p>But to proceed: <hi>Ralph de Crombwell,</hi> Son of the aboveſaid <hi>John,</hi> in the ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, obtained a Charter of Free-warren, to his Lands here at <hi>Frenſted</hi> and <hi>Meriam Court,</hi> but his Family, after the Grant of this Franchiſe, did not long poſſeſſe their Inheritance here; for <hi>Richard de Crombwell,</hi> this mans Son, about the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, paſſed it away to <hi>Hugh Girund,</hi> in whom the Title was as ſickle and volatile: for he determining in <hi>Mawd</hi> his Sole Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Heir, ſhe by matching with <hi>Henry de Chalfhunt,</hi> made it his Patrimony, and he in his Wifes Right, was ſeiſed of it at his Death, which was in the forty ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 14. And in this Family, did the Propriety of <hi>Meriam Court,</hi> and other Lands at <hi>Frenſted,</hi> continue inveſted untill the Entrance of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth; and then it was paſſed away to <hi>Hadde,</hi> now called <hi>Hadds,</hi> and <hi>William Hadde</hi> held <hi>Meriam Court,</hi> and the Land annexed to it here at <hi>Frenſted</hi> at his Deceaſe, which was in the thirty fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and in this Family was the Poſſeſſion conſtantly reſident, untill that Age which fell within the Circle of our Grandfathers Knowledge; and then it was conveyed to <hi>Archer,</hi> from which Family ſome few years ſince, it went off by Sale to <hi>Thatcher.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Yokes Court</hi> is another ancient Seat in <hi>Frenſted,</hi> which, as high as any Beam, either of Publick Record, or private Muniments, can conduct me to a Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; I find, acknowledged the noble Family of <hi>Northwood,</hi> and owned the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of that Family, untill the thirty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and then <hi>Roger de Northwood</hi> dying without Iſſue-male, bequeathed it to his only Daughter and Heir, <hi>Albina Northwood;</hi> who by matching with <hi>John Digge</hi> of <hi>Diggs Court</hi> in <hi>Berham,</hi> united this Seat to the Intereſt of that Name and Family, and they to keep Life in her Memory, (a ſmall Preferment beyond the Fate of humane Frailty,) that had improved their Paternal Inheritance with ſo great a Supplement of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Eſtate, erected a fair Monument over her Aſhes in <hi>Berham</hi> Church, and adorned it with a French Epitaph, which inſtructs the Reader, whoſe Duſt ſleeps beneath the Marble Repoſitory. Indeed in this Act, this Family ſeemed to be Corrivalls with the Egyptians, who expended more upon the Structure of their Tombs then Houſes, becauſe they knew they were to dwell longer in them. But I have digreſſed. I now proceed: Thus have you ſeen how this Seat fell under Signiory of <hi>Diggs,</hi> and the ſucceeding Records of this Family will inform you, that the Title made its aboad in this Name, untill allmoſt that Age we call our Fathers; and then it was tranſmitted by Sale to <hi>Archer,</hi> from whom not many years ſince, a Fatality like the former, hath now brought it to bee the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Thatcher.</hi>

                  <hi>Feverſham</hi> affords a Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is placed. In the year 812, in the Charter of <hi>Kenulf</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> it is called the Kings little Town. It ſeems it was of no bigg Dimenſion then, though it be multiplyed and ſwolne into a greater Bulk ſince; yet, as ſmall as it was, <hi>Athelſtan</hi> in the year 903, held a publick Moot or great Counſell here, (which Aſſemblies ſince the Normans entring here were termed Parliaments) and enacted ſeverall Laws, in this Convention. Probably enough, it belonged to the Crown in elder Times, and was a Mannor-houſe of the Kings: for <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour (as the Records of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> teſtifie) gave the Advowſon of the Church, to that Abby, in the year 1072, and the Mannor it ſelf to a Norman, in Recompence of ſome ſignal Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But when King <hi>Stephen,</hi> reſolved to erect the Abby there, he compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>William de Ipre</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> and gave him the Mannor of <hi>Lilly-Church</hi> in Exchange for it, and his Queen <hi>Matilda,</hi> raiſed a ſtately Monaſtery which ſhe ſtored with Monks, of the Order of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> which were brought thither by <hi>Clarem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> the firſt Abbot, from the Abby of St. <hi>Marys</hi> at <hi>Bermondſey</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and procured a Letter to be writ from <hi>Peter Abbot</hi> of that place, to abſolve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe them from all Obedience, to the Order of the <hi>Cluniac's.</hi> And here was K. <hi>Stephen, Matilda</hi> his Wife, and <hi>Euſtace</hi> Earl of <hi>Boloign,</hi> his Son, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Conſtable of <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle ſolemnly enter'd. Of which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer King it is obſerved, that though his Reign were rough and tempeſtuous, by Reaſon of his perptuall Debates and Conteſts, with <hi>Mawd</hi> the Empreſſe and her Son, concerning the Title; yet were there more Religious Convents erected in his Rule then either before or after; which made it appear though the Times were bad they were not impious. And certainly, from the uneven and imperfect Proſpect, which thoſe Times folded up in the Flame and Smoak of Civil War, have afforded us of this Prince, and of his Sway of the Scepter, we may conclude that in all things, he was fit to be a King, but that he was one. <hi>Thorne</hi> the Chronicler relates two Conteſts that happened between the Monks of St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> and others: the firſt was between them and King <hi>John</hi> animated by <hi>Hughbert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> touching the Right of Patronage, of the Church of St. <hi>Mary Charity</hi> at <hi>Feverſham.</hi> The K. apprehending the Advowſon of the Church, belonged to him, or at leaſt made to believe ſo by the Archbiſhop, preſents a Clerk to the Church, and commands his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment ſhould be received, which they not only diſobeyed, but ejected the Clerk, and ſent diverſe of their Monks to maintain the Poſſeſſion of the Church by ſtrong Hand. Which the King underſtanding, commanded <hi>Reginald de Cornhill</hi> the Sheriff, to diſſeiſe them and reſtore his preſented Clerk, which he in Order to the Kings Injunction, not without a vigorous Reſiſtance by the Monks effected. Upon which, the Monks complain to <hi>Stephen</hi> the Popes Legat, who then was there journeying to <hi>Rome,</hi> and in his Way ſojourned at their Cloiſter. And he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionating their Condition, adviſed them to ſend their Prior to <hi>Rome,</hi> leaſt the Power of the See Apoſtolick might, by this Affront and Inroad upon it, be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under Foot. Hereupon the Pope, upon Advertiſement received, iſſues out a Commiſſion to underſtand the Matter in Debate: But the Monks upon a ſerious Debate with themſelves, knowing the King's impetuous Temper, they found out a more compendious Method for an Accommodation, and preſented the King with two Hundred Marks in a Purſe, and a meet Palfrey for his Saddle, by which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native they ſo endeared the K. that they obtained Reſtitution of their Right, and made him for the future, their gratious Patron.</p>
               <p>Another Conflict fell out after this, between the Abbot, and Maior and Burgers of this Town, about ſome Intruſions and encroachments made by the Townſmen, as was pretended, upon the Franchiſes of the Church. You may be ſure <hi>Thorn</hi> who relates it, is warped with a partial Engagement to his own Fraternity, and with that Caution you may read him. Upon the Diſſolution made in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, this Mannor with all its Priviledges returned to the Crown, and lay incorporated with its Revenue untill the Reign of King <hi>Charles.</hi> And then it was granted to Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs</hi> of <hi>Chilham</hi> Caſtle, who not long after ſetled it on his ſecond Son Mr. <hi>Jo. Digg,</hi> who not long ſince demiſed it to Sir <hi>George Sonds</hi> of <hi>Leeze-court.</hi>

                  <hi>Fiſhbourne</hi> in this Pariſh, is an ancient Mannor, from whence a Family of that Sirname borrowed its Appellation. One <hi>John de Fiſt bourn</hi> was a Witneſſe to that Charter, by which a place called <hi>Meſſewell</hi> was given to <hi>Feverſham</hi> Abby, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond. Afterwards, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, I find the <hi>Dreylonds</hi> to be poſſeſt of it, but their ancient Seat, was at <hi>Cokesditch</hi> in this Pariſh. For in a Deed dated the twenty fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Stephen Dreylond,</hi> whereby he demiſes ſome Land in a place called <hi>Crouchfield,</hi> to <hi>William Makenade,</hi> writes himſelf of <hi>Cokesditch;</hi> and in this Family did the Intereſt of <hi>Fiſhbourne</hi> continue, untill the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth. And then it was alienated to <hi>Simons,</hi> to which Name the Title hath remained conſtantly allied to this Day. Nor was <hi>Cokesditch</hi> fixed in <hi>Dreylond</hi> by a Tenure more permanent, for <hi>katharine</hi> Sole Heir of Sir <hi>Richard Dreylond,</hi> was matched to <hi>Reginald Norton</hi> of <hi>Milton</hi> Eſquire, and ſo with her both the Name and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of this place were entombed in this Family; and this <hi>Reginald</hi> upon his Deceaſe, gave it to his ſecond Son <hi>William Norton,</hi> and from him ſucceſſively was it tranſmitted to others of that Line, untill thoſe Times which confined upon our Fathers Remembrance: And then it was alienated to <hi>Parſons,</hi> who was not long ſeated in his new Acquiſts, but he conveys it away to <hi>Aſhton,</hi> by whoſe Daughter and Heir it is lately tranſplanted into <hi>Buck.</hi>

And then that Prince, in the thirty ſecond year of his Reign, conveyed it by Grant to Sir <hi>Walter Henley,</hi> and he in the thirty fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, tranſmitted it by his Deed to Sir <hi>John Baker,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor Sir <hi>John Baker,</hi> even in thoſe Times which entrenched on our Remembrance, paſſed it away to Mr....... <hi>Cleyton</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bewper</hi> is the ſecond place of account in this Pariſh. It was in elder Times an Appendage or Fragment of that Demeaſn, which did contribute to the Support of the Abby of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> and upon the Suppreſſion of that Cloiſter or Seminary, by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, it was in the thirty fifth year of that Princes Reign, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Sir <hi>Thomas Moil,</hi> who not long after paſſed it away to <hi>Robert Prat.</hi> And his Son Maſter <hi>Franci. Prat, primo Elizabethae,</hi> by Fine conveyed it to Mr <hi>Edward Bathurſt,</hi> who not many years after, tranſplanted his Intereſt here by Sale into Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> Anceſtor to Sir <hi>Jo.

                  <hi>Wallinghurſt</hi> and <hi>Buckhurſt</hi> are two petty Mannors, which belonged to the Abby of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> but upon the Suppreſſion of that Covent, they were pared off, and by Grant from <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his Reign, were enſtated upon <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> But long he was not endowed with them: for in the thirty ſecond year of that Prince's Government, he was beſpattered and blaſted with an Accuſation of high Treaſon, which the Subtlety of his Adverſaries had woven ſo cloſely together that he was entangled in it; and being attainted, forfeited both his Life and Eſtate to the Fury, I cannot ſay Juſtice, of an incenſed Prince: Amongſt the Ruines of his Patrimony, theſe two places were comprehended, and upon his Shipwrack it returned to the Crown. And then King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, by a new Grant in the ſame year they eſcheated, paſſed them away to Sir <hi>John Baker</hi> of <hi>Siſingherſt</hi> in <hi>Cranebroke,</hi> from whom they are now come down to Sir <hi>John Baker</hi> Baronet, his Succeſſor.</p>

                  <hi>Upper Peaſridge</hi> was involved in that ſpatious Inheritance, which fell under the Dominion of the Lord <hi>Badeleſmer,</hi> of whom I ſhall ſpeak more at <hi>Leeds,</hi> and when he by his Diſloyalty had forfeited both Life and Fortune to the Crown, this was enwrapt in the Eſcheat. But was reſtored in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third to <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Lord <hi>Badeleſmer</hi> this Mans Son, and he in the twelfth year of that Prince, held it at his Death, <hi>Rot.

And in this Family did it reſide untill the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and then it was paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Sale to <hi>St. Leger,</hi> to whoſe Patrimony it remained annexed untill the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> and then an Alienation like the former, brought it over to <hi>Lone,</hi> deſcended from the <hi>Lones</hi> of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where there is yet a Houſe of the Name: and being thus fixt in this Family, the Poſſeſſion continues ſtill united to it.</p>

                  <hi>Fordwich</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Weſt-Gate,</hi> was given to the Abbot and Monks of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> (as the Annalls of that Convent teſtifie) by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, and was given <hi>ad Veſtitum,</hi> for Reparation of their Apparell. And there is a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that <hi>Hemp-Hall</hi> which was an Appendage to this Mannor, did pay a quit-Rent in Hemp: but certainly it muſt be then for the uſe of thoſe ſecular perſons which related as Officers and Servants to this Cloiſter; for the Monks themſelves being under the Rule of <hi>Bennet,</hi> harrowed their Skin with Shirts of Hair, and ſlept <hi>veſtiti</hi> in their Apparell, the more to tame and controle the Mutinies and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Fleſh. But to advance: After this Mannor (which the Piety of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages had planted in the Revenue of the Church) had for a large Decurſion of Time owned no other Proprietary; it was by the Diſſolution in the twenty ninth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, emptied into the Income of the Crown, where it lay, untill <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth in the ſeventh year of his Reign, granted it to Sir <hi>Thomas Cheyney,</hi> and he not long after alienated his Concernment in it to <hi>John Johnſon,</hi> from whom it came over by Purchaſe to <hi>Paramour,</hi> who paſſed it away to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Finch,</hi> Widow of Sir <hi>Moile Finch,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Thomas Finch</hi> Earl of <hi>Winchelſey,</hi> almoſt in our Memory paſſed it away to <hi>John Finch</hi> Baron of <hi>Ford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> late Lord Keeper of the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> in the year 1640, and in him does the inſtant Signory of it reſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Folkstone</hi> does contribute a Name to the Hundred in which it is ſituated. The Mannor it ſelf with the Mannor of <hi>Walton,</hi> was given to the Nunnery by <hi>Eadbald</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> which it ſeems was of that Repute in thoſe Times, that <hi>Eanſwide</hi> his Daughter was there vailed a Nun, under the Rule of St. <hi>Bennet;</hi> and <hi>Ermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> and <hi>Ercombert</hi> his Sons, changed their hopes of a Crown, into thoſe of one more celeſtiall, and folded up all their Earthly Glories in a Monaſtick Cowle, which they aſſumed at this place, under the Diſcipline of St. <hi>Bennet.</hi> But this Cloiſter was ſome Ages after, partly by the Fury of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and partly by the Impreſſions of the Sea, reduced into a heap of Ruines: ſo that in the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, <hi>William de Muneville</hi> laid the Foundations of a new Priory in another place of the Town; which was much augmented afterwards by <hi>William de Averenches,</hi> who had married his only Daughter. But it ſeems upon the former Devaſtation of this religious Seminary, the Mannor had returned to the Crown: for in the year one thouſand thirty and eight, <hi>Canutus</hi> reſtored to <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury</hi> (as the Records of that Covent do intimate) this Mannor of <hi>Folkston;</hi> which <hi>Athelſtan,</hi> Son of King <hi>Edward,</hi> in the year nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred twenty and eight, had formerly granted to them for the health of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Soul, and to the Honor of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lfhelme</hi> Arch-prieſt of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but with this Reſtriction, he limits and bounds this his Conceſſion, that this Mannor thus returned to the Church, ſhould never be alienated by the Arch-biſhop without the Conſent of the King and the Covent of <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> who, it appears, joyned with <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and faſtned it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to this Priory, where it remained, untill it was torn away by the Suppreſſion, in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and annexed to the Crown: Afterwards that Prince, in the thirtieth year of his Reign, tranſplanted his Intereſt in it and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> by Grant into <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Clinton,</hi> and he the ſame year paſſed them away to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who being attainted in the thirty ſecond year of the aboveſaid Prince: the Propriety of <hi>Folkston</hi> and <hi>Walton,</hi> returned to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103337:87"/>the Crown, and reſided in the Royal Patrimony, untill the ſecond year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and then they were regranted to <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Clinton</hi> aboveſaid, who not long after conveyed them to Mr. <hi>Henry Herdſon,</hi> whoſe Grandchild Mr. <hi>Francis Herdſon,</hi> alienated them to his Uncle Mr. <hi>John Herdſon,</hi> about the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and he upon his Deceaſe (without any lawfull Iſſue,) gave them to his Nephew, Sir <hi>Baſill Dixwell</hi> Knight and Baronet, deſcended from the ancient Family of <hi>Dixwell</hi> in the North-riding of <hi>York-ſhire.</hi> Who likewiſe making his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it without any lawful Iſſue, <hi>Mark Dixwell</hi> Eſquire his Nephew became his Heir, and from him is the Propriety of both theſe places deſcended to his Son and Heir, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſill Dixwell</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>The Nunnery of <hi>Folkston</hi> aboveſaid, being much defaced, was in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, reedified and reeſtabliſhed by <hi>John de Clinton,</hi> and <hi>John de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> his Wife; which was upon this ſecond Erection ſtored with Nuns, who were to live as formerly, under the Rule of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and dedicated to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Eanſwith.</hi> But when it was found, in the ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, that it related by forrein Dependance to the Abby of <hi>Lolley</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> it was by that prudent and cautious Monarch Suppreſt.</p>
               <p>There were five Churches anciently in <hi>Folkston,</hi> three of which were dedicated to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Mary,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul;</hi> all which and one more, whoſe Name is not now obvious, were long ſince by the Aſſaults of the Elements, and Devaſtations of men, utterly diſmantled: only that which was erected in the year 1095. by <hi>Nigellus de Muneville,</hi> and devoted to St. <hi>Mary</hi> and St. <hi>Eanſwith,</hi> hath been too hard a Morſel for the teeth of Time to conſume.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Folkston</hi> had the Grant of a Market procured to be held here weekly on the Thurſday, by the Mediation of <hi>Geffrey Fitz-Peter,</hi> in the ſixth year of King <hi>John,</hi> which was confirmed to <hi>William de Averenches,</hi> in the ſixteenth year of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Prince, and renewed to Sir <hi>John Segrave,</hi> in the twenty ſecond year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond granted to Sir <hi>John Clinton,</hi> that a Market ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved weekly at <hi>Folkston,</hi> on the Wednesday, and a Fair yearly on the Vigil, and Day of St. <hi>Giles,</hi> as appears <hi>Pat.</hi> 13. <hi>Richardi ſecundi Membr.</hi> 14. <hi>Pars</hi> 2.</p>

                  <hi>Eabald</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> about 1000 years ſince, built a Caſtle at the South part of this Town of <hi>Folkston,</hi> which being ſhrunk into Decay, <hi>William de Averenches</hi> erected a Fort in the year 1068, on the Foundation of the formerly demoliſhed Pile, whoſe ruinous Shell or Skeleton is yet viſible,</p>
               <p>I have ſeen a Leafe by ſome injurious Hand torn out from the <hi>Leiger</hi> Book of <hi>Folkston,</hi> which ſets forth the entertainment which the Family of <hi>Poynings</hi> were to have, when they came to hear Maſſe at the Priory; a ſubtle Artifice uſed by the Monks of that Age, to catch the Benevolence of the nobleſt and moſt opulent Families of the Nation, that certainly (had not the Statute of Mortmain, or Law of Amorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation made in the ſeventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, reſtrained and contracted the unlimited Bounty of the Laity to theſe religious Cloiſters,) almoſt all the Land which was of ſecular Intereſt, had been ingulphed in the Revenue of the Church: ſo that as one well obſerves this over-active and operative Devotion, would have dedicated all to God, and have left Little or Nothing to have given to <hi>Caeſar.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Terlingham</hi> and <hi>Ackhanger,</hi> were the Patrimony as high as the Reign of the Conquerour (as Doomſday inſtructs us) of <hi>William de Muneville,</hi> the Repairer and Reſtorer, if not Founder and Eſtabliſher of <hi>Folkston</hi> priory. By whoſe Daughter and Heir they devolved to <hi>William de Averenches,</hi> who had Iſſue <hi>William de Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renches,</hi> in whom the male-line failed, ſo that <hi>Matilda de Averenches</hi> his Sole Heir by matching with <hi>Hamon de Crevequer,</hi> Baron <hi>Leeds</hi> Caſtle, made them parcel of his Demeaſne: who by his Addition, ſo ſwelled his Eſtate, that he was ſtyled the great Lord of <hi>Kent,</hi> and was of that Eſteem in this County, that by a generall Conſent and Councell of the Barons of the Cinque-ports, the Cuſtody of the Sea-Coaſt from <hi>Haſtings</hi> to <hi>Pool,</hi> was committed to his Care and Inſpection, <hi>Pat.</hi> 19. <hi>Hen. tertii Memb.</hi> 14. And he held theſe Mannors at his Death, which was in the forty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 33. And left them to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103337:87"/>his Son <hi>Hamon de Crevequer,</hi> who was enwrapt in the Faction and Rebellion of <hi>Simon de Montfort</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> raiſed againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the third; but was, by that Act of Oblivion and Clemency, ſtyled <hi>Dictum de Kenilworth,</hi> paſſed by that Prince in the fiftieth year of his Reign, called to <hi>Mercie,</hi> and to moſt part of his Eſtate, excepting <hi>Leeds-Caſtle, Berſted, Chetham,</hi> and ſome other peices, but dyed without Iſſue; ſo that <hi>Eleanor</hi> matched to <hi>Bertram de Crioll, Juliana</hi> firſt matched to <hi>Nicholas de Sandwich,</hi> and ſecondly to <hi>Roger de Segrave,</hi> and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who were wedded to <hi>Lenham,</hi> and <hi>Pateſhull,</hi> became, as they were his four Siſters, his four Coheirs. And upon the partition of the Eſtate, theſe two Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors came over to be the Patrimony of <hi>Crioll,</hi> and <hi>Bertram de Crioll</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned held them at his Death, which was in the twenty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 48. And left them to <hi>John</hi> his only Son, who dying Childleſſe, <hi>Joan</hi> his Siſter matched to Sir <hi>Richard de Rokeſley,</hi> became his Heir: but he determining likewiſe in a Female Heir called <hi>Joan,</hi> ſhe by eſpouſing Sir <hi>Thomas de Poynings,</hi> Father of <hi>Michaell de Poynings</hi> of <hi>Terlingham,</hi> raunged theſe places under the Demeaſn of that Family, in which they remained, untill the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh: and then Sir <hi>Edward Poynings,</hi> gave them in Dower, with <hi>Mary</hi> his natural Daughter to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Clinton,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Edw.</hi> Lord <hi>Clinton,</hi> about the Beginning of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> by Sale paſſed them away to <hi>Herdſon,</hi> from whom by Teſtament they came over to <hi>Dixwell,</hi> in which Family the Poſſeſſion of them is ſtill permanent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Morehall</hi> is a ſmall Mannor in this Pariſh, to which, <hi>William de Valentia</hi> obtained a Charter of Priviledges, in the twenty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. After him I find the <hi>Morehalls</hi> to be Poſſeſſors of it, who ingrafted their own Name upon it, and <hi>John de Morehall,</hi> paid reſpective Aid, at the making the Black Prince Knight, for his Mannor of <hi>Morehall,</hi> in the twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. After this Family was extinct, the <hi>Bakers</hi> of <hi>Caldham,</hi> about the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, were inveſted in the Poſſeſſion, and not many years after, <hi>Brandred</hi> by one of the Coheirs of <hi>Baker,</hi> became Lord of the Fee: from which Family, by Sale, it paſſed away to Sir <hi>Thomas Brown,</hi> from whom deſcended Sir <hi>Mathew Brown</hi> Knight, who in our Grand-fathers Memory conveyed his Right in it to <hi>Godman,</hi> who is ſtill Lord of the Fee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hope-Houſe</hi> in <hi>Folkston,</hi> belonged to the <hi>Houghams,</hi> a noble and knightly Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabiting at <hi>Hougham</hi> not far diſtant, and <hi>Robert de Hougham</hi> dyed ſeiſed of it in the forty firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. In the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, I find the <hi>Clintons</hi> poſſeſt of it, and <hi>William de Clinton</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> dyed ſeiſed of it in the twenty eighth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third: and from him it deſcended to his Kinſman <hi>John de Clinton,</hi> great Grandfather to <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Clinton,</hi> who about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, ſold it away to <hi>Davis,</hi> from which Family by a Daughter, and partly by Purchaſe: it came over to <hi>Leſſington,</hi> and he in our Fathers Remembrance, alienated his Concernment in it to <hi>Hopday,</hi> whoſe Son is the inſtant Poſſeſſor of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bredmer</hi> or <hi>Berdmer,</hi> is the laſt place worthy any Conſideration. It is partly ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in <hi>Folkston,</hi> and partly in <hi>Cheriton;</hi> that there was a Family of this Name, was moſt certain. For in ancient Deeds and Court Rolls of <hi>Valoigns,</hi> who was Lord of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riton</hi> after <hi>Scotton:</hi> I find frequent mention of ſeverall of this Name, who held Land of this Family. But in the Book of <hi>Aid,</hi> I find <hi>William de Brockhull</hi> held the fourth part of a Knights Fee in <hi>Cheriton,</hi> which was this, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. From this Name by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Heir of <hi>Thomas Brock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hull,</hi> it came to be the poſſeſſion of <hi>Richard Selling</hi> Eſquire, and here it reſted untill the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was paſſed away to <hi>Edmund Inmith,</hi> a Retainer to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Clinton,</hi> who gave it to his ſecond Son <hi>Edmund Inmith,</hi> and he was extinguiſhed in two Daughters and Coheirs: one was married to <hi>Reyner,</hi> and the other to <hi>Baker,</hi> who in her Right ſhared this place, and in the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> paſſed it away by Sale to <hi>Ben,</hi> who holds the inſtant Poſſeſſion of it.</p>

               <p>The Treaſurer of the Navy, hath here a commendable and convenient Houſe for his Reſidence at the Dock, to view the building and repayring the States Ships and what is moſt expedient for the Manufacture of Cordage, Anchors, and other Proviſions for Ships, by which means the Town is ſo greatly increaſed in ſmall Tenements, and the Statute for Cottages, excepting Market-Towns, and ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as are uſed for building of Ships, that for number of Inhabitants and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, it may compare with diverſe Counties in the Kingdome: which great Increaſe of the Pariſh, cauſed them to new build another Iſle on the North-ſide the Church, to which the Eaſt-Indian Company of Merchants were good Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, And the Chancel enlarged with beautifull Additions, partly at the Coſt of Sir <hi>William Ruſſell</hi> Knight and Baroner, Treaſurer of the Navy, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection of Doctor <hi>Valentine,</hi> the late learned and worthy Incumbent of the place.</p>
               <p>Adjoyning to the Church, The Company of Navigators and Seamen, incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, have a Hall or Houſe for their meetings and Conſultations. Certainly the uſe of this Society, is moſt conſiderable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable: for the Common-wealth, upon all Occaſions, may from them receive neceſſary Intelligence of all the Roads, Waterings, Depths, and Conveniences, of moſt part of the Maritime places in the Known World.</p>
               <p>One thing more I have to mention: and that is <hi>Hacham,</hi> which was, in K. <hi>Hen.</hi> the ſeconds Time, the Seat of <hi>Hacham,</hi> lying upon the Confines of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Kent-fields</hi> or <hi>Kent-lands,</hi> within this County; as <hi>Kent-Hatch</hi> in <hi>Weſterham,</hi> is the very out-ſide of this Shire: As that place towards <hi>Surrey,</hi> called <hi>Kent-Houſe,</hi> deſigns the Bounderies of this County, between <hi>Bekenham</hi> and <hi>Croydon.</hi> Divers Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, taken ſince that time, have found <hi>Hacham</hi> to be in <hi>Kent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I believe the Mannor of <hi>Bredingherſt,</hi> before mentioned, was formerly in this Shire, which is now ſlipt into <hi>Surrey</hi> at <hi>Peckham Rey,</hi> in <hi>Camberwell.</hi> The Reception of Priſoners, from the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> being for a good Space u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be at <hi>New Croſs,</hi> hath begot an opinion, that there was the out-ſide of <hi>Kent:</hi> but thoſe that will juſtly denote the <hi>Ambitus</hi> and Bounds, muſt not think it begins at <hi>Kent-ſtreet,</hi> becauſe it is ſo called of the Road-way into <hi>Kent.</hi> Nor that <hi>Kentiſh Town</hi> by <hi>High-gate,</hi> is part of this Shire, though it pertake of the Cuſtomes of Gavel-kind. Nor at Sir <hi>Thomas Waterings,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the forty third of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, it appears, that the Mannor of <hi>Hacheſham,</hi> was granted to the Prioreſſe of <hi>Dertford,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cauſ. 43. E, 3.

Adam,</hi> were confirmed to that Foundation by the King: all which returning into the Hands of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, upon the publike Suppreſſion, this Mannor, with its Appendages, was for ever ſetled by the Crown, on the Company or Brother-hood of the <hi>Haberdaſhers</hi> in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eaſt-Greenwich</hi> is the next Town to <hi>Detford,</hi> ſo called, becauſe it ſtandeth more Eaſt-ward then the other, formerly ſpoken of. In Latin named <hi>Viridis Sinus,</hi> in Saxon <hi>Grenawic,</hi> that is, the Green Town, upon the Turning Creeke of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>In the Time of the <hi>Danes</hi> Invaſion, they often made their Road at this place, and made it remarkable, by their Cruelty, ſhewed unto <hi>Ealphege</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> whom in the year of our Lord, a thouſand and twelve, they cruelly executed with moſt exquiſite Torments, whoſe Death together with the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Ditmarius Merſepurgius,</hi> who about the ſame time lived, hath thus, in the eighth Book of his Chronicles deſcribed. I underſtood (ſaith he) by the relation of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103337:89"/>
                  <hi>Sewald,</hi> a pitifull Deed, and therefore memorable, namely, that the perfidious Crew of Norman Souldiers, under <hi>Thurkill,</hi> as yet their Captain, took that excellent Prelate, Arch-biſhop of the Citty of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> named <hi>Ealphege,</hi> with the reſt, and them after their wicked manner impriſoned and bound, yea and put him to endure Famine, and unſpeakable pains. This good man moved with humane Frailty, promiſeth unto them a Summe of Money, and for the obtaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, did ſet down a Time between. That if in this Space, he could not by ſome acceptable Ranſome, eſcape this momentary Death, he might yet in the mean while purge himſelf with many a Grone, to be offered as a lively Sacrifice unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>But when as the Time and ſpace appointed were come and gon, this greedy Gulph of Pirats, called forth the Servant of the Lord, and in threatning-wiſe demand this Tribute promiſed unto them, to be ſpeedily and out of hand paid. Then he, as a Meek lamb, Here am I, quoth he; ready to undergo, (even for the Love of Chriſt) whatſoever ye preſume now to do againſt me, that I may deſerve to become an example of his Servants: and nothing am I troubled at this day. And whereas I ſeem unto you a Lyer, it is not my own Will, but great need and Poverty that hath done it: This body of mine, which in this Exile I have loved over much, I preſent as culpable unto you; and I know it is in your Power, to do with it what yee intend: but my ſinfull Soul, that regardeth not you, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly commend to the Creator of all things. As he was thus ſpeaking, the whole Rabble of theſe prophane Wretches hemmed him round about, and getteth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether diverſe and ſundry weapons to kill him: which when their Leader <hi>Thurkill</hi> ſaw a far off, he came quickly running, and crying, do not ſo I beſeech you, and here with my whole heart, I deliver unto you all my Gold and Silver, and whatſoever I have here, or can by any means come by, ſave my Ship only, that you would not ſin againſt the Lord's annointed. But this unbridled anger of his Mates harder then Iron and Flint, was nothing mollified with ſo gentle Words, and fair Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his, but became only pacified by ſhedding his innocent blood, which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they altogether confounded and bleanded with Ox-heads, Stons as thick as Hail, and Billets hurled at him.</p>
               <p>And to the memory of this ſaid <hi>Ealphege,</hi> is the Pariſh Church here conſecrated. But far more ſplendid hath this ſumptuous Pallace been, ever ſince <hi>Humphrey Duke</hi> of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> Brother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, builded the ſame, and called it <hi>Placence;</hi> And likewiſe the Caſtle, and incloſed the Park: For doing them both, he had the King's Charter XI. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>Rex concedat quod Humfridus Dux Gloceſtriae, &amp; Elianora uxor ejus, poſſdent Karnellare Manerium ſuum de Eaſt-Grenwich, &amp; Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care</hi> CC. <hi>Acras terrae inter Manerium ſuum praedictum.</hi> For it was not lawfull for any man to fortifie his Houſe, or raiſe a Caſtle or place of Defence without Licence from the Crown, for Fear of inward Sedition: and was therefore inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable before the Eſcheator in the twenty fourth Article of his Office. <hi>Item de Caſtellis &amp; Dominicis Karnellatis ſine Regis licencia.</hi> The word having its deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Charneux,</hi> whichin French ſignifieth the indented Form of the Top of a Wall, which hath vent and creſt, commonly called Imbattelling, becauſe it was very ſerviceable in fight to the Defendant within, who might at the loops or lower places, and other cranies in the Walls and Bulworkes, annoy the Enemy, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled the ſame, and might alſo ſhroud himſelf under the higher Parts thereof.</p>
               <p>Afterward King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, beſtowed ſome coſt, to enlarge this work. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, followed and beautified the Houſe, with the Addition of the Brick Front to the water ſide. But King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, as he exceeded all his Progenitors in ſetting up ſumptuous Houſes, ſo he ſpared no Coſt in Garniſhing <hi>Greenwich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> in the time of King <hi>James,</hi> builded that new Brick-work towards the Garden, and laid the Foundation of the Houſe of Delight, towards the Park, which Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> hath ſo finiſhed and furniſhed, that it far ſurpaſſeth all other of that kind in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Memory of the many Camps that have been here, Certain places within this Pariſh, are called <hi>Combes,</hi> namely <hi>Eaſt-Combe,</hi> where that godly good Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman

                  <hi>Weſtcombe</hi> with its Appendant Members, related to the noble Family of <hi>Bade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſmer,</hi> and upon the Attainder of <hi>artholomew</hi> Lord <hi>Badeleſmer,</hi> eſcheating to the Crown, they lay claſped up in its Revenue; untill King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to Sir <hi>Robert Belknap</hi> the Judge; upon whoſe Attainder, they were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Fee to <hi>Robert Ballard</hi> Eſquire <hi>Pincernae ſuo</hi> his grand Boteler.

               </p>
               <p>Soon after the Conqueſt, this <hi>Greenwich,</hi> was parcell of the Poſſeſſions of the Biſhop of <hi>Liſeux</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and bore Service, to <hi>Odo</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Baieux,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Kent.</hi> After, the Mannor belonged to the Abbot of St. <hi>Petres</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> till ſuch time, as King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, ſeiſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Hands (by occaſion of War) the lands of the Priors Aliens, beſtowed it together with the Mannor of <hi>Lewſham,</hi> and many other Lands alſo, upon the Priory of the Brotherhood to the Monks of <hi>Shene</hi> which he had then newly erected, to which it remained till the Time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, who annexed it to the Crown, unto which it now belongeth, and is called the Honor <hi>Eaſt-Greenwich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were both born here; and King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, a Miracle of Princely Towardneſſe, ended his Life, in the ſame Houſe.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, 1376, in the fifty firſt year of his Reign founded the Religious Houſe of Friers Aliens, or Dominican Friers. Sir <hi>John Norbury</hi> Knight, high Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> is reckoned a Benefactor to the ſame, after the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this Houſe, and its Annexion to <hi>Shene</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth.</p>
               <p>Another Houſe of obſervant Friers was erected here, by King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, as we read in <hi>Jo. Roſſe. Circiter Annum Regni Edwardi quarti, venerunt Fratres ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervantes Ordinis Minorum ad Greenwich, &amp; habebant Cantariam &amp; Capellam Sancti Crucis.</hi> And King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, builded that Houſe for them adjoyning to the Pallace, which is yet there to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>There are moreover in the Town, two Colledges or Almes houſes, for the Suſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of poor Perſons, the one builded by <hi>William Lambert</hi> Eſquire, which he named the Colledge of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> poor People, and as the Prying Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of out Religion then obſerved, was the firſt Proteſtant that built an Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital.</p>
               <p>The other ſtanding by <hi>Thames</hi>-ſide, was founded by <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> Lord Privy Seal, Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, and Knight of the Garter. And inlarged and Beautified the Caſtle, (which is famous in the Spaniſh Fables) from whence there is a moſt fair and pleaſant Proſpect open to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, winding in and out, almoſt redoubling of it ſelf, the green Medows and Marſhes underlying the Citty of <hi>London,</hi> and Country round about.

               <p>And alſo for a <hi>L'env'oy</hi> to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> you may read the Verſes of <hi>Leland</hi> the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarian</hi> Poet adjoyning to <hi>Greenwich. Blackheath,</hi> of which the Hundred taketh the name, ſo called of the colour of the Earth, or Bleacheath of the high and cold Situation, for bleak ſignifieth cold. Alſo <hi>Campus Martis,</hi> it may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: for beſides the Burthen of the Daniſh Camps, it hath born three rebellious Aſſemblies. One in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, Moved, as ſhall be farther declared in <hi>Offham,</hi> by <hi>John Tylar,</hi> whom <hi>William Walworth,</hi> then Maior of <hi>London,</hi> ſlew with his Dagger in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and thereupon, upon the Tradition
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103337:90"/>comes, that the City had given them, for an Augmentation to their <hi>Eſchochen,</hi> a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the Dexter-point or Canton, ſo to be born by them for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jack Cade</hi> that Counterfeit <hi>Mortimer,</hi> and his Crew, conducted the ſecond, who araying themſelves here, and paſſed to <hi>London,</hi> where they did to Death the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and others, and executed their malice upon the Records and Monuments of the Law; Burning down the Office of Armes, which was then kept at <hi>Cole-Harbour,</hi> burning, deſtroying their Rolls, Regiſters, and Books of Armory; Their main Drift and Deſign, being to bring in Parity.</p>
               <p>And their Inſurrection was here aſſembled, by <hi>Michaell Joſeph</hi> Black-ſmith, and the Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> under the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh; at which time they and their Complices received their juſt Deſert: the Common Numbers of them, being diſcomfited and ſlain, and the Leaders themſelves, taken, drawn and hanged.</p>
               <p>Of this laſt, there remaineth yet, to be ſeen upon the Heath, the place of the Smith's Tent, called commonly his Forge; and of all, there the great grave-Hills of ſuch as were buryed, after the overthrow. Theſe Hills, in the Weſt-Country, upon diverſe Champions and Plains (where is no ſmall Store of the Like) are called <hi>Barowes,</hi> of the old Engliſh word <hi>Burghes;</hi> which laſt word, melted into Buryings, (being a Spring of the old Stock) we do yet retain alive.</p>
               <p>The firſt and laſt of theſe Commotions were ſtirred of Grieſe, the Common people conceived for the Demand of two Subſidies. Of which the one was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, becauſe it was taxed upon the Polls, and exempted none. The other was unſeaſonable, for that it was exacted, when the heads of the common people were full of <hi>Perkin Warbeck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third and middlemoſt, grew upon a grudge, that the People took for yielding the Dutchie of <hi>Aniou,</hi> and <hi>Maine,</hi> to the King of <hi>Sicily:</hi> The coming of whoſe Daughter, (after that the King would needs have her to Wife, notwithſtanding, his precontract made with the Earl of <hi>Armenac</hi>) was not ſo joyfully embraced, by the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> upon <hi>Blackheath,</hi> wearing their red Hoods, Badges, and blew Gowns, as in Sequele the Marriage and whole Government it ſelf, was known to be deteſted of the Country Commons, by bearing in the ſame place, Harneſſe, Bowes, Bills, and other Weapons. Thus far, the Story of <hi>Blackheath</hi> proves but ſad and tragical: That which remains, is of a more glorious and ſplendid condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſiſting of Ovations and Triumphs; for when the Emperour of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> came to require Aid againſt the Turks, King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, with all Princely reſpect, went to meet him at this place, and ſo conducted him to <hi>London.</hi> And when King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, returned from his victorious Conqueſt of <hi>France,</hi> the Lord Maior and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> went forth in their beſt Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, to attend his Reception at this place, at which time the King made many Knights Bannerets; And K. <hi>Hen.</hi> the eighth, that excelled in all Triumphal matters met <hi>Anne Cleve,</hi> daughter to the Dake of <hi>Cleve.</hi>

                  <hi>Graveney</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Boughton,</hi> was in the year of our Lord eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eleven, by Archbiſhop <hi>

In the year of <hi>Grace</hi> eight hundred and thirty, <hi>Werhardus</hi> a Prieſt of much Power in <hi>England,</hi> (by the injunction of the Arch-biſhop) gave <hi>Graveney</hi> to the Monks of <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> which had been before ſnatched away, and then paſſed under the Notion of thirty two Hides; and if you will ſee how it was rated, in <hi>Doomſ-day</hi> Book, it is thus there repreſented: <hi>Graveney, eſt Manerium Monachorum, &amp; eſt de Veſtitu eorum, quod Richardus Conſtabularius tenet in Feodo de Archiepiſcopo, &amp; tamen reddit firmam Monachis, &amp; pro</hi> 1 <hi>Sulling ſe defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</hi> This Mannor by the Succeſſive Proprietaries, was held in Fee, of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here was a Family called <hi>Gravenell,</hi> who were Lords of this Mannor, which <hi>John de Gravenell,</hi> dyed poſſeſt of, in the fifty ſixth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. Afterwards I find the <hi>Feverſhams,</hi> a Family ſo called, held it. <hi>Richard Feverſham</hi> was ſeiſed of it at his Death, which was in the thirteenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Rot.

But dyed likewiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue-male, ſo that his Eſtate here, which devolved to him by Female Right, by the ſame Fate, was carried away to <hi>John Martin,</hi> one of the Judges of the Common-Pleas, who married <hi>Ann</hi> his Sole Heir, and this Man lyes buryed in <hi>Graveney</hi> Church, under a Fair Stone inlaid with Braſſe, and his Pourtraicture inſculped thereon, with this Inſcription affixed. <hi>Hîc jacet Joannes Martin, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciarius de communi Banco, qui obiit</hi> 24 <hi>Octobris,</hi> 1436, <hi>&amp; Anna Uxor ejus.</hi>From <hi>Martin,</hi> the Propriety of that Eſtate here, which had been diverſe years entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to this Name, went by Purchaſe into <hi>Pordage</hi> of <hi>Rodmerſham,</hi> in which Family the Poſſeſſion hath for ſeveral Generations been conſtantly reſident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Graveſend</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Toltingtrow,</hi> was anciently the Poſſeſſion of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily called <hi>Cramavill,</hi> who had likewiſe very conſiderable Poſſeſſions in <hi>Eaſt-Kent.

Warren de Montchenſey,</hi> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <hi>Milton,</hi> in the thirty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and he had Iſſue <hi>William de Montchenſey,</hi> who held it at his Death, which was in the fifty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third: and left it to <hi>Dionis</hi> his Female Inheritrix, wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Hugh de Vere,</hi> by whom ſhe having no Iſſue, that might tranſmit the Poſſeſſion to his Family; the Intereſt of it was, by <hi>Joan,</hi> Siſter and Coheir of the abovementioned <hi>William,</hi> knit to the Patrimony of her Husband, <hi>Aymer de Valence</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke;</hi> whoſe Son <hi>William de Valence</hi> dying without Iſſue, <hi>Iſabell</hi> his Siſter and Coheir, being wedded to <hi>Lawrence de Haſtings,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,</hi> united it to his Demeaſn, and his Grandchild <hi>John de Haſtings,</hi> about the beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Simon de Burley,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attainted of high Treaſon, in the tenth of his Rule, becauſe, according to his Oath, being Knight of the Garter, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, he endevoured to underprop, like ſome Buttereſſe, the ſinking Prerogative of his Maſter, againſt the onſets of ſome of the ambitious Nobility, it eſcheated to the Crown. And then the aforeſaid King, in the fourteenth year of his Government, granted it to <hi>John Holland</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington;</hi> and he not long after conveyed it by Sale, to <hi>Reginald Cobham,</hi> whoſe Widow, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was remarried to <hi>William Clifford</hi> Eſquire, and he in her Right, I find, was poſſeſt of it in the ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. But after his Death, it reverts to <hi>Braybrook,</hi> who had mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with <hi>Joan</hi> the Heir general of <hi>Cobham,</hi> and he determining likewiſe in an Heir general, matched to <hi>Brook,</hi> of the Weſt-country, it devolved with <hi>Cobham,</hi> to acknowledge the Signiory of that Family, but continued not long in their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion: for about the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, I find it in the Tenure of <hi>Robert Brent,</hi> from whom it deſcended to his Son <hi>William Brent,</hi> who in the eighth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, conveyed it to Sir <hi>Henry Wiatt;</hi> and from him
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103337:91"/>did it come down to his Grandchild Sir <hi>Thomas Wiatt,</hi> who being attainted in the ſecond year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> it eſcheated by Confiſcation to the Crown, and then it was granted to <hi>George Brook</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and went along with that Family, untill the beginning of King <hi>James,</hi> and then <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Brook</hi> having embarked himſelf in the unhappy Deſign of Sir <hi>Walter Rauleigh,</hi> was atrainted of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and his Concernment in this Mannor, was forfeited to the Crown, and was, not many years after, by the above-mentioned Prince, granted to Mr. <hi>George Tucker</hi> of <hi>Graveſend;</hi> whoſe Grandchild Mr. <hi>George Tucker,</hi> hath lately paſſed away all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt here to Mr...... <hi>Hamon,</hi> of Queenhith in <hi>London.</hi>

Afterwards, this Mannor was linked to the Revenue of the Crown, but whether it was thus annexed by Sale, or by Exchange, I confeſſe, I am ignorant: only I find by the original Patent, that in the ſixth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, it was granted to Sir <hi>Simon de Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley;</hi> upon whoſe Attaint, in the tenth year of the aboveſaid Prince, it devolved to the Crown, and <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, not long after, ſetled it on the Abby of St. <hi>Mary Grace</hi> on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> in whoſe Revenue it remained untill King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth tore it off by the Publique Diſſolution, and united it to the Royall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, where it had its fixed aboad, untill the thirteenth year of King <hi>James:</hi> and then it was granted to Mr. <hi>William Salter;</hi> who not many years after, paſſed it away to Mr. <hi>James Criſpe;</hi> from whom in our Memory, partly by Purchaſe, and partly by Exchange, it went over to Mr. <hi>Jo.

                  <hi>Gillingham,</hi> was a Mannor always relating to the Arch-biſhops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> though the Donation by the Book of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> be not ſpecified.

                  <hi>Eaſt-court,</hi> and <hi>Weſt-court</hi> in this Pariſh, were anciently knit together, and reſided in a Family called <hi>Gillingham. Richard de Gillingham,</hi> Son of <hi>Thomas de Gillingham,</hi> held it at his Death, which was in the twelfth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 176. And left it to his Son <hi>Thomas Gillingham,</hi> who reſolved into two Daughters and Coheirs; <hi>Margaret</hi> married to <hi>John Thorpe,</hi> who in her Right, had <hi>Weſt-court;</hi> and <hi>Iſabell,</hi> matched to <hi>William Crenſted,</hi> who brought along with her <hi>Eaſt-court.</hi> But as all things have their Fate and Viciſſitude, they did not long acknowledge the Dominion of either of them; for <hi>Thorpe</hi> ſold <hi>Weſt-court</hi> to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Lawſon,</hi> of <hi>Whoorn-place</hi> in <hi>Cuckston,</hi> who not long after, by the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, paſſed it away to <hi>Duling</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> by whoſe Female Heir, it is now come over to Mr. <hi>Stephen Alcock:</hi> but <hi>Thorp; Ferme,</hi> on which he had planted his own Name, he alienated to <hi>Short,</hi> and from this Family it went away again by Sale to <hi>May</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter.

               <p>
                  <hi>Twidall,</hi> is another Mannor of eminent Account, and had Owners likewiſe of that Appellation. The firſt, that I find of the Name, in Mr. <hi>Painter</hi>'s Evidences, which held both this and <hi>Dane-court,</hi> is <hi>Robert de Twidall,</hi> and he ſlouriſhed here
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103337:91"/>about the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, and he had Iſſue <hi>Adam de Twidall,</hi> from whom was lineally extracted, <hi>Richard de Twidall:</hi> who in the fourth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, paſſed away this, and <hi>Dane-court,</hi> to <hi>John,</hi> the Son of <hi>Robert de Beaufitz,</hi> originally deſcended from <hi>Reade</hi> in <hi>Marden.</hi> But in this Family, the Poſſeſſion was not very permanent, for in ſome Deſcents after, the Name went out into into <hi>Joan Beaufitz</hi> and other Coheirs: and ſhe by matching with <hi>Robert Arnold</hi> of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> did enſtate the Poſſeſſion of both theſe places, upon this Name and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he bequeathed them as Dower, to his Daughter <hi>Elizabeth Arnold:</hi> and ſhee, in the thirteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, conveys them over to her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Henry;</hi> and his Son <hi>William Arnold,</hi> in the eighteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, tranſports his Right in them by Sale to <hi>Thomas Benolt Clarenceux</hi> King of Arms: from whom the like Conveyance, in the twentieth year of that Prince, brought itto Sir <hi>Hen.

               <p>The <hi>Grange</hi> in this Pariſh, ſometimes written <hi>Grench,</hi> did in the Conquerours time, appertain to the old Lords called <hi>Haſtings,</hi> Anceſtors of the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> now Earl of <hi>Huntington.</hi> In the Book called <hi>Teſta de Nevill,</hi> kept in the Exchequer we read that one <hi>Manaſſer de Haſtings,</hi> held <hi>Grench</hi> by Serjeanty under King <hi>Hen.</hi> the third, and the particular Office, in ſome more modern Records is deſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is held of the King (and not of the Cinque-ports as ſome do ſuggeſt) by Serjeanty, to find two men and two Oars in the Ship, which carries over the King from <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>Whiteſand</hi> by <hi>Callis.</hi> From <hi>Haſtings,</hi> it came over by Purchaſe to <hi>Richard Smelt</hi> Alderman of <hi>London:</hi> whoſe Daughter and Heir <hi>Margaret Smelt</hi> carried it away to <hi>Richard Croyden</hi> likewiſe an Alderman of <hi>London:</hi> in whom the male-line failing, <hi>Margery</hi> his Sole Heir was matched to <hi>John Philipott</hi> Eſquire, Alderman of <hi>London</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and Lord Maior of <hi>London,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, by which Prince he was inveſted with the Order of Knighthood, for being ſo ſignally inſtrumental in the Ruine of <hi>Wat Tiler, Jack Straw</hi> and his ſeditious Complices, and had after the Addition of <hi>Gules,</hi> A <hi>plain Croſſe</hi> between four <hi>Swords</hi> Argent, <hi>Pomell'd, Or,</hi> as a Coat of Augmentation annexed to his Paternal Coat, <hi>viz.

Yet how laudable ſoever the work were, it eſcaped not the Envy of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him at the Couucel-Board, for that he being a private Perſon, had embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked himſelf in an Attempt of ſo much Concernment, without Order and Licence firſt obtained by the State: but by the noble Favour he received from his hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Friends there, eſpecially <hi>Rychard Fitzallan</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundell,</hi> whoſe Arms he placed in his Houſe, as a Monument of Gratitude, and left him a Legacie in his Will, he was fetched off with Reputation. But to proceed, in Right of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Alliance, he was planted in the Poſſeſſion of this Mannor, and from him it devolved to his Grandchild <hi>John Philipott</hi> Eſquire. And he in the eleventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, exchanged this Mannor with Sir <hi>Richard Bamme,</hi> Son of <hi>Adam Bamme,</hi> Lord Maior of <hi>London,</hi> for <hi>Twiford</hi> in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and from him it deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>John Bamme</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Richard</hi> the third.

                  <hi>Lidſing,</hi> is the laſt place of Account in this Pariſh, it was, in Ages of a higher Aſcent, the Inheritance of an ancient Family, called <hi>Sharſted.

In Ages of a lower Computation, I find <hi>Roger de Say,</hi> to be poſſeſt of it; and he about the fiftieth of <hi>E.</hi> the 3d. gives it to <hi>Rob. Belknap</hi> the Judge, who about the tenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, was by Sentence from Parliament, exiled into <hi>Ireland,</hi> for too vehemently aſſerting the Prerogative of the Crown, which in the Eſtimate of thoſe Times, was thought to have opened thoſe ſluces too much, which would have let in the Inundations of an arbitrary Power upon the people's Liberties. But this Mannor was again reſtored by that Prince who looked upon this perſon as his Martyr, to him as its ancient Poſſeſſor, in the twenty ſecond year of his Reign, and he by his Deed, bearing Date the eighth of <hi>October,</hi> in the ſecond year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, gives it to the Priory of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> for one Monk who was a Prieſt, to celebrate Maſſe for ever for the Soul of his Father <hi>John Belknap,</hi> and for the Soul of his Mother <hi>Alice,</hi> Wife of the ſaid <hi>John,</hi> and likewiſe for the Soul of himſelf, and all his Succeſſors, in the Cathedrall of <hi>Rocheſter.</hi> This, upon the Diſſolution of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Priory, was by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, upon his Inſtitution of the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> granted to them for their ſupport and Alimony, and reſted in their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue untill theſe Times.</p>
               <p>There was another Chauntry founded at <hi>Twidall,</hi> by <hi>John Beaufits,</hi> which he makes proviſion for, by his laſt Will, the twenty ſecond of <hi>November,</hi> in the year of our Lord, 1433, and orders it to be dedicated to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and likewiſe that one Prieſt ſhould there celebrate Maſſe for the Soul of Himſelf, his Wife <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> his Father <hi>John,</hi> his Mother <hi>Iſabell,</hi> and his Uncle <hi>William Beaufitz:</hi> the Seats in the Chappel, and other Remains, declare it to have been formerly a neat and elegant Piece of Architecture.</p>
               <p>Here was a ſignall Encounter (as the Annals of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> teſtifie) between <hi>Edmund Ironſide,</hi> and <hi>Canutus</hi> the Dane, wherein, after a Sharp Debate, the Dane was broken and diſcomfited.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Gillingham</hi> likewiſe (as <hi>Thomas Robburn</hi> a Monk of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> teſtifies) was acted that bloody Tragedy by Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> who ſlew all thoſe Normans who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived

                  <hi>Rolling,</hi> is a third place in this Pariſh to be taken notice of: It contributed a Seat as well as a Sirname, formerly, to a Family called <hi>Rolling.

                  <hi>Egerton</hi> in <hi>Godmerſham</hi> was a Mannor which formerly ſwelled the demeaſn of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Family of <hi>Valence,</hi> who were Earls of <hi>Pembroke. Aymer de Valence</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> held it at his Death, which was in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, as appears <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 75. And leaving no lawfull Iſſue, this, upon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of his Eſtate, increaſed the Revenue of <hi>John Comin</hi> Earl of <hi>Badzenoth</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had married <hi>Joan</hi> one of his two Siſters and Coheirs: But long it remained not here, for he deceaſed without any Iſſue-male, ſo that <hi>Joan</hi> his ſole Daughter, matched to <hi>David de Strabolgie</hi> Earl of <hi>Atholl,</hi> became his Heir, and he in her Right, was found to be inveſted in the Poſſeſſion, in the firſt year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, as is manifeſt <hi>Rot.

And from him did it devolve by Deſcent, to his Son and Heir, <hi>David de Strabolgie,</hi> who in the ſeventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, by Deed, ſetled it on his Kinſman Sir <hi>Henry de Hills,</hi> which, <hi>Katharine</hi> his Widow and Counteſſe confirms, the twentieth year of that Prince: <hi>Gilbert de Hills,</hi> lieth buryed in <hi>Godmerſham Church,</hi> and as appears by his Pourtraict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure in his Armour, was a perſon of Eminence in that Age, wherein he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and from him, and Sir <hi>Henry de Hills,</hi> did iſſue forth many eminent and worthy Succeſſors, who were Proprietaries of this Mannor, untill that Age which fell within the Precincts of our Crandfathers Memory, and then it went away by Sale to <hi>Scot,</hi> a Cadet or younger Sprig of the <hi>Scotts</hi> of <hi>Scotts-Hall:</hi> the Heir Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of which Family, was Mrs. <hi>Dorothy Scott,</hi> who being lately matched to Mr. <hi>Daniell Gotherſon,</hi> he in her Right is now (though not without a ſignal Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Law, with ſome collateral Pretenders to the Title) peaceably planted in the Poſſeſſion of it.</p>

                  <hi>Godmerſham</hi> as the Records of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> inform mee, had the Grant of a Market, to be obſerved weekly on the Tueſday, and a Fair yearly upon the Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and Friday, in <hi>Whitſon</hi> Week by the Prior of <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third.</p>

                  <hi>Goudherſt</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Marden,</hi> with the inherent Mannor of <hi>Bedgebury,</hi> were the ancient Patrimony of a Family of no cheap Account in this Track, which, as it choſe one of theſe Mannors for its Seat, ſo did it derive its Sirname from thence likewiſe, and was called <hi>Bedgbury,</hi> and certainly were of a very high Aſcent in their Extraction. For in a Deed without Date, one <hi>John de Bedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> demiſes ſome parcels of Land to <hi>William de Comden</hi> of <hi>Comden Houſe</hi> in this Pariſh, and the Seal affixed to this Deed is a Cavalier on Horſeback, armed, like one of the Knights Templers, which argues that he lived before the Suppreſſion of that Order, and aſſumed that Impreſſe out of his particular Affection to them; or elſe, which was cuſtomary in thoſe Times, out of ſome ſignall and ſolemn vow, to maintain the Temple of our Saviour, from the Aſſaults and barbarous Impreſſions of Infidels, which theſe perſons were by their Oath, and firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, oblieged vigorouſly to defend alſo. <hi>John de Bedgebury,</hi> this man's Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, paid reſpective Aid for his Lands at <hi>Goudherſt,</hi> and likewiſe for his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Bedgebury,</hi> at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and left theſe above recited Mannors to his Son <hi>John de Bedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> who dying without Iſſue, his Siſter became his Sole Inheritrix, who by matching with <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> of <hi>Bayhall</hi> in <hi>Pepenbury,</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> in the eighteenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, faſtned the Propriety of theſe places, to the Intereſt of this Family, where they continued undivided, but in the thirty eighth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, Court <hi>Shingley</hi> was by <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated to <hi>Stephen Darell:</hi> but <hi>Goudherſt</hi> and <hi>Bedgebury,</hi> were not plucked away from this Family, by this Alienation, but continued united to their Eſtate, ſo that at this Day they own <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> Eſquire, for their Proprietary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Combwell</hi> was a Priory of Black Canons, under the Rule of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and was founded by Sir <hi>Robert de Thurnham,</hi> and dedicated to the Honor of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> Their Revenue lay ſcattered in <hi>Marden, Stapleherſt,</hi> and <hi>Goudherſt;</hi> in which laſt, there was an obſcure Cell, or Convent of Nuns, which had their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Subſiſtence by their Charity, whoſe Ruines are yet viſible, though their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, was ſo narrow, that no Record informs us where it was ſituated. Upon
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103337:94"/>the Diſſolution in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, this devolving to the Crown, that Prince in the thirty fourth year of his Government, granted it to Sir <hi>John Gage,</hi> one of the Juſtices of the Peace, both for <hi>Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Kent;</hi> and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor conveyed it to <hi>Colepeper,</hi> who immediately after, paſſed it away to <hi>William Campion</hi> Eſquire, Anceſtor to Sir <hi>William Campion,</hi> who was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up a Sacrifice, to the Cauſe and Quarrel of the laſt King at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> in the year one thouſand fix hundred forty eight, and in his Heirs is the Intereſt of this Mannor at this inſtant reſident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finchcocks</hi> is a third place of note in this Pariſh, made more eminent in that it was the Manſion of a Family of that Sirname, whom, although I find inveſted in the Poſſeſſion of this place, ever ſince the fortieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, yet do I not diſcover that any of the Family was illuſtrious by any important under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, or famous by any eminent Office. The next Family which ſtept into the Poſſeſſion was <hi>Horden</hi> of <hi>Horden;</hi> and he became Proprietary of it by Purchaſe about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, one of which Family was <hi>Edward Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> Eſquire, who was Knight of the Greencloth to <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> who dyed without Iſſue-male, and left his Eſtate to be ſhared between two Daughters and Coheirs, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> matched to Mr. <hi>Paul Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt,</hi> deſcended from <hi>Bathurſt</hi> Street in <hi>Nordiam,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> eſpouſed to Mr. <hi>Delves</hi> of <hi>Fletchings,</hi> who in her Right carried away <hi>Horden,</hi> where certainly, the above-recited Family had flouriſhed under a noble Eſtimate; for <hi>Edward Horden</hi> the laſt of this Name was iſſued out from <hi>William Chichley,</hi> ſecond Brother to <hi>Henry Chichley</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and for ſome conſiderable Service performed to the Crown, had the Augmentation of a Regal <hi>Diadem,</hi> upon a <hi>Canton</hi> added to his paternal Coat, by Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> But to proceed, <hi>Finchcocks</hi> by the above-mentioned match, devolved to be the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Bathurſt,</hi> and ſo owns it ſelf at this Day, to be the Eſtate of this Name and Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Patenden</hi> is another place which gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of no vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Repute in this County, and was ſeated in its Poſſeſſion, as appears by ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Deeds and other old Records, as high as the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and where, in the twenty ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, there was iſſued out a Commiſſion to <hi>Gervas Clifton</hi> Eſquire, then Sheriff of the County, to return all thoſe, who did <hi>portare Arma antiqua.</hi> Amongſt the Regiſter and Catalogue of thoſe who were then returned, <hi>Patenden</hi> is recorded, who was Lord of this place, and from him did the Propriety of this place by Deſcent glide down to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, who, in thoſe Times we ſtyle our Fathers, paſſed it away by Sale to Mr. <hi>Bathurſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Borough</hi> of <hi>Twiſden,</hi> is a fifth place, which invites us to a Survey. It was in elder Generations the Inheritance of <hi>Twiſdens,</hi> upon whom, I may without any Supply of Flattery, ſtrew thoſe juſt Attributes of Ancient and Noble. The firſt, that I find by Deed to be of this Family, Poſſeſſor of it, was <hi>Adam de Twiſden,</hi> and he was ſeiſed of it,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>This</hi> Rog. Twiſden <hi>was Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to the Abby of St.</hi> Auguſtins <hi>a place of great Truſt in thoſe Times.</hi>
                  </note> in the one and twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt. In times of a lower Deſcent, <hi>Roger Twiſden</hi> was poſſeſt of it, and in the fifth year of <hi>H.</hi> the fourth, affixes to a Deed now in the Hands of Sir <hi>Roger Twiſden,</hi> of <hi>Roydon</hi> Hall, Baronet, the Signature or Impreſſion of a Cockatrice on Wax. The Creſt, which, at this Day, is annexed to the paternal Coat of this Family, a rare thing in thoſe Times when Creſts were infrequent and unuſuall, and began to be cuſtomary, when thoſe eminent Familyes who were embarked in the two Factions, of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> aſſumed them to ſerve as Evidences or Symbols of Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whereby the Son might avoid the plunging his Sword in the Bowells of his Father, or a Brother the Sheathing his in the Entrails of his Brother. But to proceed, the laſt of this Name, who poſſeſt this place, was <hi>Roger Twiſden,</hi> who about the Beginning of <hi>H.</hi> the ſixth, paſſed it away to <hi>Roger Twiſden,</hi> and he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after conveyed it by Sale to <hi>Geffrey Allen,</hi> who about the latter end of <hi>H.</hi> the ſixth, ſetled the Right of it by Deed in <hi>Thomas Windhill.</hi> And thus far do the Copies of diverſe original Evidences, which relate to this Place, extend and no farther. After this, it was for diverſe Deſcents wrapt up in the Propriety of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who not many years ſince expiring in a Female Inheritrix, ſhe, by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103337:94"/>with Mr. <hi>Fowle</hi> a Cadet of the <hi>Fowles</hi> of <hi>River-Hall</hi> in <hi>Suſſen,</hi> hath made it the preſent Poſſeſſion of that Name and Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shingley</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Goudherſt,</hi> which belonged to that Revenue which did own the Signory of the Priory of <hi>Leeds,</hi> and upon the ſuppreſſion, when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of this Cloiſter was broken to peeces by the Scepter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, this was in the thirty ſixth year of that Prince granted to <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> of <hi>Bedgebury</hi> Eſquire, with all the Priviledges which it was fortified with, when it related to the abovementioned Cloiſter, as namely to be Tith-free, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Title (ſuch a Moath and Canker cleaves to the Patrimony of the Church when it is tranſplanted) made no long ſtay in <hi>Colepeper,</hi> for in the thirty eighth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, this <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> alienated it to <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Thomas Darrell;</hi> but in this Family like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was the Poſſeſſion of as frail a permanence: for they nor long after conveyed it to <hi>William Campion</hi> Eſquire, Counſellor at Law, from whom it deſcended to Sir <hi>William Campion</hi> Governor of <hi>Borestall</hi> Houſe near <hi>Oxford,</hi> for His Late Majeſty, and who was after ſlain at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> aſſerting the Royal Intereſt, and in his Deſcendants is the Propriety of it ſtill wrapped up.</p>

                  <hi>Bokinfold</hi> is the laſt place of Conſideration in <hi>Goudherſt;</hi> it was a Mannor which related to that Chauntry, which was founded here by <hi>Hamon de Crevequer,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with all the Franchiſes annexed to it by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, in the one and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of his Raign, and in this Patent of Inſpection and Ratification, it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that <hi>Hamon de Crevequer,</hi> was its Founder: But the common Diſſolution in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, renting away (like ſome ſuddain and impetuous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent) this Mannor from thoſe Ends and Uſes it was firſt deſigned to, lodged it in the Crown, and then the aboveſaid Prince in the one and thirtieth year of his Raign, granted it to <hi>Paul Sidnore</hi> Gentleman, and he not long after conveyed it to Sir <hi>John Gates;</hi> but he being one of the principal Emiſſaries or Complices of <hi>John Seymour</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> being inwrapped and ingaged paſt Recovery in the Deſign of the above ſaid Duke, ſunk in the Ruines of that unfortunate Peere, and was convicted of High Treaſon, and beheaded on Tower-Hill, in the fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth. Upon his Tragedy, this Mannor returned to the Crown, and ſtayed there, until the Beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then it was granted to <hi>Katherine Tong,</hi> who not long after paſſed it away to <hi>Colepeper</hi> of <hi>Bedgebury,</hi> who, almoſt in our remembrance, paſſed away that part of this Great Mannor, which is circumſcribed within the Verge of <hi>Goudherſt</hi> to the inſtant Proprietary <hi>Brewer.</hi>

               <p>In Times of a very high Aſcent, Arch-biſhop <hi>Hubert,</hi> and after him Arch-biſhop <hi>Baldwin</hi> had a Deſign to have erected a Colledge firſt here at <hi>Hackington,</hi> and then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſecond Thoughts at <hi>Lambeth;</hi> but the Monks of Chriſt-church, believing that this intended new Seminary of Religion, might ſomething by its Interpoſition darken the Glory and Grandeur of their Covent, firſt by <hi>Alanus</hi> their then Prior, and afterwards by Proxie, ſo vigorouſly oppoſed this Project at <hi>Rome,</hi> that by the Favor and Indulgence of the then Popes, it was vacated and extinguiſhed: But in times ſubſequent to theſe, theſe Monks having much endeared <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> the then Arch-biſhop, by beſtowing ſome Signal Favors on <hi>Simon de Langton</hi> his Brother, the Controverſie, which was fomented by the above mentioned Deſign, by his compliance with the Monks was appeaſed, and entombed in an amicable Pacification.</p>

                  <hi>Broad-oake</hi> is another little Mannor in <hi>Hackington,</hi> which anciently made up the Demeaſne of the Noble Family of <hi>Hadlow:</hi> for <hi>Nicholas de Hadlow,</hi> I find had a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Free-warren to his Lands at <hi>Medgrove</hi> and <hi>Broadoake,</hi> in the one and twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt: After <hi>Hadlow</hi> was extinguiſhed, the ancient Family of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres</hi> of upper <hi>Hardres</hi> were ingrafted in the Inheritance, and one <hi>Edmund Hardres,</hi> as I diſcover by an old Court-roll, held it in the fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi rend="sub">th.</hi> and after him his Grand-child <hi>George Hardres</hi> died poſſeſt both of the Lands at <hi>Medgrove</hi> and <hi>Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oake,</hi> in the one and twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and in this Name was the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion conſtant until the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then they were paſſed away by Sale to Sir <hi>Edward Boughton</hi> of <hi>Burwaſh</hi> in <hi>Plumſted,</hi> and his Son <hi>Thomas Boughton</hi> Eſquire, in the ſeventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, alienated them to <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald Highgate</hi> and <hi>William Hanwick,</hi> and they not long after conveyed them to ...... <hi>Roper</hi> Eſquire, from whom they are now by Deſcent tranſmitted to his Succeſſor, Mr. <hi>Edward Roper</hi> of <hi>Well Hall</hi> in <hi>Eltham.</hi>

                  <hi>Hadlow</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Hadlow Borough</hi> &amp; <hi>Littlefeild,</hi> gave both Seat &amp; Sirname to a Family ancient and conſpicuous enough in this Track: but whether the ſame with that Family which was ſeated at <hi>Hadlow-place</hi> in <hi>Crundall,</hi> is altogether ambiguous; certain I am that <hi>Edmund de Hadlow</hi> died ſeiſed of it in the thirty ſecond of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and from this Name in the ſubſequent Age it came to the Crown, but whether by Eſcheat, Exchange, or Purchaſe; no Beam, ſcattered from any private or publique Record, can ſo far enlighten my Knowledge as to diſcover. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, in the twenty fifth of his Raign, granted this and many other Poſſeſſions, lying about the Skirts of the <hi>Lowey</hi> of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> to <hi>Humphrey Stafford</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and with this Name it went along till <hi>Edward Stafford</hi> being infortunately offered up a Sacrifice to the Malice and Ambition of Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and the Loſſe of his Head having been the expiation of ſome Vanities, which he had been too much Guilty of, the Right by his Attaint flowing back into the Crown, it was inveſted in the twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth by Royal Conceſſion in <hi>John Vane</hi> Eſquire, whoſe Succeſſor Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> not many years ſince ſold it to <hi>Thomas Petley,</hi> whoſe deſcendant now enjoyes it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peckham</hi> in this Pariſh was part of the Patrimony of the Noble Family of <hi>Peckham,</hi> and one <hi>John Peckham</hi> (as the Book called the Survey of the Mannors of <hi>Hadlow,</hi> taken in the fourteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth informs me) anciently poſſeſt it, from which Name it was by Sale rent away, and incorporated into the Intereſt of <hi>Colepeper;</hi> for <hi>John Colepeper</hi> (as the above mentioned Survey inſtructs me) ſold it to <hi>Leigh,</hi> and after the Poſſeſſion had been for ſome intermiſſion of Time riveted into this Family, it was by the ſame Alienation taken away, and by <hi>John Leigh</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittted to Sir <hi>George Rivers,</hi> whoſe Son Sir <hi>John Rivers,</hi> did lately upon his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe as his Heir ſucceſſively claim it.</p>

               <p>The Mannor of <hi>Fromonds</hi> is mentioned likewiſe in the aboveſaid Survey: It gave Sirname to <hi>Fromonds,</hi> Anceſtor to <hi>Fromond</hi> of <hi>Cheame</hi> in <hi>Surrey;</hi> but whether it yeelded Seat likewiſe, is the Queſtion. Certain it is, it ſtaid not long in this Name: for <hi>Richard Fromond</hi> ſold it to <hi>Colepeper:</hi> nor was it long fixed or conſtant in this Family neither; for <hi>Richard Colepeper</hi> after the ebbing away of ſome ſucceſſive Generations caſt the Poſſeſſion by ſale into <hi>John Fromond</hi> again, originally extracted from the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Richard Fromond:</hi> and to this Name this Seat and its Intereſt continues (for ought I can yet diſcover) at this inſtant faſtned and united.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cauſton</hi> is the next (becauſe it owned a Family of that Sirname) that claims our Conſideration. It was in Ages of higher Aſcent, the Demeſne and Intereſt of ſome of this Name; but whether the <hi>Cauſtons</hi> of the County of <hi>Salop</hi> were iſſued from hence, or theſe of this Seat extracted originally from thence, is yet under diſpute; and the more, becauſe Eviderce of Deeds, which is the Lant horn, not only of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, but ſometimes of Reaſon likewiſe, is wholly wanting. It is without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, this Manſion was not long in the <hi>Cauſtons,</hi> for the thread of Succeſſion was interrupted and broken, and <hi>Hugh Cauſton</hi> by Sale conveyed it over to the <hi>Wattons</hi> of <hi>Addington:</hi> nor was it long reſident here, for <hi>William Watton</hi> ſold it to <hi>Thomas Peckham</hi> branched out from the <hi>Peckham,</hi> of <hi>Yaldham</hi> in <hi>Wrotham,</hi> from whom by a like Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that changed the Scene and Face of the Title; it was alienated to <hi>Vane,</hi> and after ſome ſtay in that Name, lately by Purchaſe made the Propriety of <hi>Maynard</hi> of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild</hi> in the County of <hi>Suſſex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Totlingbery</hi> had the Repute of a Mannor alſo, and was the Manſion ſometime of that Name, till Time the great Channel of all Things, that either ſinks or preſerves them, carried it down from <hi>John Totlingbery,</hi> to the Family of <hi>Roberts</hi> of <hi>Glaſtenbury</hi> in <hi>Cranbrook,</hi> and the ſame ſtream of viciſſitude wafted it not long after from <hi>Walter Roberts</hi> the Laſt of that Name, which enjoyed it, to <hi>John Vane</hi> Eſquire; where (no Record or Evidence ſuggeſting yet any thing to the contrary) I think it yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goldhell</hi> may be looked upon as a place of ſome importance, ſince ſome Families of Eſtimate have been Poſſeſſors of it, for firſt it was the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Bealds;</hi> ſo they are ſtyled in the Survey. And when this Family began to moulder away, the Title by Sale ſhifted it ſelf to the <hi>Fromonds,</hi> a Name eminent enough in this Track: and when they began to languiſh away into the common Familty of Families: <hi>John Fromond</hi> ſold it to the <hi>Colepepers</hi> of <hi>Oxenhoath.</hi> And this Branch of the <hi>Colepepers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding at laſt in three Daughters and Coheirs; one of them being wedded to <hi>Cotton</hi> of <hi>Lanwade</hi> in the County of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> made this Part of the Revenue of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; but they deſiring to contract their Intereſt into a nearer Circumference, caſt this by ſale into the Poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>George Chowne,</hi> to whoſe Succeſſor it very lately entitled it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goding</hi> and <hi>Crombery</hi> are Mannors of ſome Signal Reſpect, ſince they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged themſelves to be part of the Patrimony of <hi>Fromond,</hi> a Family by an eminent Succeſſion of Gentry noble and conſpicuous, which being by Time broken and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered; it not long after was by <hi>Thoma Fromond</hi> ſold to <hi>John Goding.</hi> From whom after the ſeries of that Name was by the ſame alteration interrupted; it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the <hi>Peckhams,</hi> where it hao not long made its Reſidence, but the Title by purchaſe (like an Orbe never much in repoſe) rowled it ſelf from <hi>Thomas Peckham</hi> into <hi>Vane,</hi> where for ſome years it has reſted.</p>

                  </hi> ſhall be the laſt mentioned, (though not in the above ſpecified Survey, yet) in mine, in Relation to this Pariſh. The firſt Family that I track in the Record to be Poſſeſſors of it, were the <hi>Bakers</hi> of <hi>Eaſt-Peckham,</hi> in which Name the Propriety of it lay wrapt up, till <hi>Richard Baker</hi> did deveſt himſelf of his Right, and paſſed it over by Sale to <hi>Burgeſſe:</hi> where it had not long dwelt, but the ſame Change untwined it. For <hi>Thomas Burgeſſe</hi> alienated it to <hi>Henry Leigh,</hi> and in his Succeſſor (till a clearer Ray of more Modern Intelligence, directs me to believe the Contrary) I think the Poſſeſſion is reſident.</p>
               <p>There are two other Seats of Venerable Account in this Pariſh. The Mannor of the Rectory is the firſt, which in the year 1287. was by <hi>Thomas de Inglethorp</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> (as the Records of that Church ſignifie) appropriated to the Knights of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103337:96"/>St. <hi>John,</hi> otherwiſe called the Knights Hoſpitalers, and remained locked up in their Demeaſne, until the publique Suppreſſion ſnatched it away, and united it to the Crown, where it lodged until the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and then it was granted to Sir <hi>Ralph Vane,</hi> whoſe Deſcendant about the middle of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> paſſed it away to <hi>Roger Twiſden</hi> Eſquire, Captain of a Troop of <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Gentlemen at the Camp formed at <hi>Tilbury,</hi> to oppoſe the Hoſtile Eruptions of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> in the year 1588. And from him it is now come by Deſcent to be poſſeſt by his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, that learned and accompliſhed Gentleman Sir <hi>Roger Twiſden</hi> of <hi>Roydon Hall,</hi> Knight and Baroner.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is <hi>Fiſh-Hall,</hi> the Manſion formerly of <hi>John de Fiſher,</hi> ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was inveſted with a Priviledge by <hi>Gilbert de Clare,</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and Lord of the <hi>Lowey</hi> of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> to have the Fiſhing freely and uncontrouledly within his Juriſdiction, or as far as it did extend, ſo that from this Immunity or Franchiſe, his Poſterity contracted the Sirname of <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and for ſome Ages, did the Right of it remain interwoven with the Demeaſne of this Family, till <hi>Richard Fiſher</hi> ſold it to <hi>John Vane</hi> Eſquire, from whom the ſame Revolution not long after tranſported it to <hi>Rivers</hi> of <hi>Chafford,</hi> and now the Title is ingrafted into a yonger Branch of that Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Halling</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Shamell,</hi> has nothing remarkable in it but the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Langridge, aliâs Bavent;</hi> for ſo it is written frequently in Records, and indeed not without ſome Reaſon to ſupport the Orthography; for in Times of elder Preſcription, it gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family that had that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, and there is ſome Track or Print yet of the Ruines of a Manſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in that Feild, which is at this Day called <hi>Bavents;</hi> and <hi>Roger de Bavent</hi> died in poſſeſſion of it in the thirty firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third: and when this Name was worn out, the next which we find in Succeſſion to be Proprietary of it, was <hi>Langridge,</hi> a Branch ſpouted out from that Stem of <hi>Langridge,</hi> which was anciently planted in the County of <hi>South-hampton.</hi> And when this Family was decayed and vaniſhed, and had left nothing to evidence to us that it had once a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here: but the adopting this Mannor into its Name, the Poſſeſſion went into <hi>Melford,</hi> and here, after it had had ſome ſhort abode, it abandoned this Family, and caſt the Intereſt of it into the Patrimony of <hi>Raynwell,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor after ſome ſhort Flux of Time (as appears by the Book of Aid kept in the Exchequer) ſold it to <hi>Robert Wotton,</hi> in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and he ſuddainly after alienated this and other Lands to <hi>Whorne</hi> of <hi>Cuckston;</hi> nor was the Title any length of Time lodged in this Name; for a Fate of the ſame condition with the former carried it over to <hi>Vane,</hi> from whom it flowed away in the ſame Current, and by Sale emptied it ſelf into <hi>Barnewell,</hi> nor was it leſſe permanent there, for the ſame inconſtant Tide wafted it down to <hi>Nicholas Lewſon,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Lewſon</hi> his Grand-child, deſirous to wrap up all his Intereſt within the County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated his <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Lands to ſeveral perſons, and ſold thoſe which were part of his Demeſne here to <hi>Barber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mannor of <hi>Halling</hi> it ſelf was given to the Church of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> by <hi>Egbert</hi> King of the Weſt <hi>Saxons,</hi> in the year of our Lord 838. and has continued parcel of the Churches Patrimony in an uninterrupted Succeſſion of Time, till the year 1643. and then the Title was raveled and diſcompoſed.</p>

                  <hi>Halden</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Blackborne</hi> and <hi>Barekley</hi> has nothing worthy in it that may oblige a Remembrance, but only <hi>Hales-place,</hi> from whence, as from their Fountain, the ſeveral Streams of the <hi>Hales,</hi> that in divided Rivulets have ſpread themſelves over the whole County, did originally break forth. But where this <hi>Hales-place</hi> is now placed, or in what Angle of the Pariſh it is ſituated: I confeſſe I cannot inſtruct my ſelf, unleſſe it be that Great Houſe which was the Original Seat of the <hi>Scots,</hi> before they planted at <hi>Congerherſt</hi> in <hi>Haukherſt,</hi> and which <hi>Reginald Scot</hi> ſold to Sir <hi>Edward Hales.</hi> Indeed it is often mentioned in the Pedigree of <hi>Hales,</hi> and likewiſe in the Deeds of that Family, as lying in <hi>Halden,</hi> which is evidence enough that there was ſuch a Manſion in this Pariſh; though peradventure through
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103337:96"/>Neglect and Diſuſe, and by altering its Poſſeſſor, it have at preſent loſt its Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Halſtow</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Hoo,</hi> was anciently part of the Barony of <hi>Bardolph,</hi> but did not long reſt here, for <hi>Iſolda</hi> the Daughter and Co-heir of <hi>Hugh de Bardolph,</hi> being married to <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> this was thrown into that Scale (with other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſnes of vaſt Eſtimate) which did after ſwell the Revenue of this Baron into a huge Dimenſion. But, as all ſublunary matters have the Fate of an uncertain incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy written in indelible Characters upon them, ſo had this; for <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> this mans Succeſſor, ſold it to <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and he died poſſeſt of it in the thirty ſixth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, from whoſe Heir an equivalent Viciſſitude reſigned it up to the illuſtrious Family of <hi>Zouch;</hi> and <hi>William La Zouch,</hi> extracted from the <hi>Zouches</hi> of <hi>Haringworth</hi> in the County of <hi>North-hampton,</hi> died actually poſſeſt of it in the fifth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond; and after the Title had been ſome years knit to the Relation and Intereſt of this Family, it was at length torn off by the rough Hand of Time, and by Sale ſurrendered up to <hi>Norris,</hi> from whoſe Heir by as quick a Tranſition it conveyed it ſelf over to Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> Grand-father to Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> Baronet, now ſurviving.</p>

                  <hi>Halsted</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Codſheath</hi> was the Inheritance of a good old Family called <hi>Malavill,</hi> who were of no contemptible Account in this part of the County; for in the Pipe-Rols, relating to the Raign of King <hi>John,</hi> I diſcover, that <hi>Robert de Malavill</hi> was one of the <hi>Recognitores magnae Aſſiſae,</hi> in the fourth year of that Prince, and then again in the ſeventh year of his Rule, he was dignified with that eminent Place of Truſt, and he had Iſſue <hi>William de Malavil,</hi> who was in the enjoyment of this Mannor at his Death, which was in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, as appears by an eſcheat Roll, marked with the number 56. And in this Family did the Right and Title of it lie involved, untill the latter End of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; and then the noted Family of <hi>Bures</hi> ſtept by Purchaſe into the Poſſeſſion, and <hi>John Bures,</hi> (as appears to me by an old Deed) held it in the fourth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond; he was Son of <hi>William Bures,</hi> who paid reſpective Aid for part of a Knights-fee, which lay in <hi>Bromley,</hi> in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight; and <hi>William Bures</hi> Son of <hi>John</hi> lies entombed in <hi>Halſted</hi> Church, pourtraied at length in Braſs, and mail'd in Armor upon a fair Grave-ſtone, being Marble, with this Inſcription: <hi>Hic jacet Willielmus Bures Armigeri Dominus Manerii de Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, qui obiit</hi> 1454. And this was he who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the eleventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth: But after his Death it was not long in the Fruition of this Name; for about the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, I find it in the Hands of <hi>Thomas Bourchier,</hi> deſcended from the <hi>Bourchiers</hi> of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and he about the Latter End of that Prince, paſſed it away to <hi>Stephen Petley</hi> Eſquire, who lies buried in <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted</hi> Church. And in this Family was the Title fixed, untill the Beginning of King <hi>James,</hi> and then the Fatality of Sale did alternate the Poſſeſſion, and annexed it to the Inheritance of Sir <hi>Thomas Watſon,</hi> who dying without Iſſue-male; his only Daughter and Heir was eſpouſed to Sir <hi>William Pope,</hi> afterwards created Earl of <hi>Downe</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> by King <hi>James,</hi> and ſo in her Right this Mannor became the Inheritance of his Son, the Right Honourable <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Downe,</hi> who not many years ſince paſſed it away to Mr. <hi>Edward Aſh,</hi> whoſe Widow Mrs. ........ <hi>Aſh,</hi> holds it at this inſtant in Right of Dower.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Halſtow</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Milton,</hi> hath nothing memorable in it, but <hi>Berkeſore alias Baſſer-court,</hi> which was, as high as any print of Antiquity can direct me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, the Patrimony of the Church; for King <hi>Stephen</hi> devoted it to find a ſupply of perpetual Lights before the Cheſt or Shrine (<hi>ante Capſam,</hi> thoſe are the words of the Record) of <hi>Anſelme</hi> the eminent Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and it hath been many years paſt held by the <hi>Darrels</hi> of <hi>Cale-hill</hi> as Leſſees, and is ſtill by that Right enjoyed by Sir <hi>John Darrell</hi> of the ſame place.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Halſtow,</hi> (as the Records of Chriſt-church inſtruct us) was given by <hi>Boniface</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to buy Books, for the Chaunter of that Covent.</p>

               <p>The other Moity of <hi>Hamme,</hi> belonged to the <hi>Criolls</hi> of <hi>Walmer,</hi> of which Family I ſhall ſpeak more at that Place: <hi>Simon de Crioll,</hi> as I diſcover by old Deeds, held it in the Raign of King <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and tranſmitted it to his Son <hi>Nicolas de Crioll,</hi> who held it at his Death, which was in the one and thirtieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and from him did it by the ſteps of ſeveral Generations deſcend to Sir <hi>Thomas Crioll,</hi> who was ſlain at the ſecond Battle of Sr. <hi>Albans,</hi> tamely, and in cold Blood; that is, he was beheaded by Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> wife to King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, in the thirty eighth of that Prince's Raign, becauſe he had been an eager Partiſan of the Houſe of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and being thus infortunately cut off, left that great Eſtate he was poſſeſt of, in this County, to two Daughters and Co-heirs, one of which was matched for his ſecond wife to <hi>John Fogg</hi> of <hi>Repton</hi> Esq; Son and Heir of Sir <hi>William Fogg,</hi> and he had Iſſue by her <hi>Thomas Fogg,</hi> Serjeant Porter of <hi>Callis</hi> Eſquire, a Place of eminent Truſt and Concernment in thoſe Times. And he ended in two Daughters and Co-heirs; <hi>Anne</hi> firſt matched to Mr. <hi>William Scott,</hi> Brother of Sir <hi>Reginald;</hi> and ſecondly, to Mr. <hi>Henry Iſham,</hi> and <hi>Alice</hi> firſt wedded to <hi>Edward Scott,</hi> of the <hi>Moat</hi> in <hi>Suſſex</hi> Eſquire, and after to Sir <hi>Robert Oxenbridge,</hi> of the County of <hi>South-hampton;</hi> but the Moity of this Mannor of <hi>Hamme,</hi> upon the dividing the Eſtate into equal Portions, fell to be the Inheritance of <hi>Edward Scott,</hi> in Right of <hi>Alice</hi> his wife, and his Deſcendant in our Grand-fathers Remembrance alienated all his Intereſt and Concernment here, to <hi>Bois</hi> of <hi>Betſhanger,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor Mr. <hi>John Bois</hi> of <hi>Betſhanger</hi> Eſquire, is now entirely poſſeſt of this Mannor; as namely, of that Moity, which came over to this Family, by Purchaſe from <hi>Oxenbridge,</hi> as well as of that, which devolved to this Name, by Purchaſe from <hi>Scott.</hi>

                  <hi>Harbledowne</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Weſtgate,</hi> though at preſent but an obſcure Village, and not of much Eminence, was in Time of more ancient Date famous for three memorable Places. Firſt, for an old Chappel ſituated upon the Margin of that Precipice which overlooks that way which leads to <hi>Canterbury.</hi> In which Oratory, as Tradition informs us, was preſerved the Slipper of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> taken from one of his Feet after his being deſtroyed at his own Church at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and which, as Report inſinuates, was beſpattered with his Blood; this being curiouſly enchaſed with Diamonds (ſo much did thoſe Times dote on this then reputed Saint and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr) was let down for Paſſengers, who travelled to <hi>Canterbury</hi> to offer up their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons at his Shrine, to adore with a kiſs; nor was it returned, but full fraighted and laden with the Benevolences of devoted Pilgrims.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was <hi>Polres,</hi> which anciently had and ſtill keeps the Repute of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; <hi>John de Polre,</hi> Son of <hi>John de Polre</hi> payd reſpective Aid for it, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; and when after ſome expiration of Time, this Family began to find the common Sepulcher which wairs upon all Humane Glory, Decay and Oblivion; the <hi>Martins,</hi> a Name of generous extraction in this Track, ſtept in and by Purchaſe became Lords of the Fee, and held it, till the Name being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted into <hi>Anne</hi> Sole Daughter and Heir of <hi>Jo. Martin</hi> by marriage with <hi>Roger Brent;</hi> it was knit to the Patrimony of that Family, and ſo for ſome years remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolved, till the Union by Sale was broken; and not long ſince paſſed over to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103337:97"/>Sir <hi>Thomas Bind;</hi> where, at preſent, the Poſſeſſion is wound up with the other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſne of that Family.</p>
               <p>The Mannor of <hi>Beverley</hi> is a third place of Note in <hi>Harbledowne.</hi> It was the Sear of the ancient Family of <hi>Beverley,</hi> before they removed to <hi>Tancrey</hi> Iſland in <hi>Ford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich;</hi> and having remained Proprietaries of it many Generations, by Efflux and Deſcent it was guided down to <hi>William Beverley</hi> Eſquite, from whom the Title eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed away, and in whom the Name determined; for, he deceaſing without Iſſue Male, <hi>Beatrix</hi> was his only Daughter and Heir, who was matched to <hi>Thomas Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Eſquire, by which Alliance, the Title of this place became inter-woven with his Inheritance, and continued claſped up in it, until the middle of the Raign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then it was conveyed to <hi>Merſeday,</hi> in which Family it had a ſetled Reſidence, until ſome ſew years ſince the Mutation of Sale brought it to one Mr. ....... <hi>Richardſon</hi> for its Proprietary.</p>

                  <hi>Lanfranck,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the year 1071. Founded an Hoſpital at <hi>Harbledowne</hi> for Lepers, employed afterwards to the Uſe of aged people. <hi>William Wittleſey</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the year 1371. founded a Chauntry here, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated it to the Honor of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> which Foundation, in the year 1402. Was by Arch-biſhop <hi>Arundell</hi> fully ratified and confirmed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nether-Hardres</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Bridge</hi> and <hi>Petham,</hi> is eminent for two Places ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated within the Precincts and Ambuts of it. The firſt is <hi>Hepington,</hi> which certainly was anciently the <hi>Chichs</hi> of the <hi>Dungeon</hi> in <hi>Canterbury;</hi> for I have ſeen a Record, wherein <hi>Nicolas Meſingham</hi> releaſes his Right in this and divers other Lands confining on <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> to <hi>Tho. Chich.</hi> But let it be granted, it was theirs; certainly the Title was very vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile and incertain; for I find the <hi>Foggs</hi> when they expired, to be next in Poſſeſſion of it, which was as high as the entrance into the Raign of <hi>Hen.</hi> the fourth. And here for ſome Ages the Title fixt it ſelf, till at length the Fatality of Time paſſed it over by Sale to <hi>Hales,</hi> one of whoſe Succeſſors has lately ſold the Manſion Houſe to Sir <hi>Thomas Godfrey,</hi> but ſtill preſerves the Propriety of the Mannor it ſelf in his Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lindeſhore,</hi> but vulgarly called <hi>Linſore,</hi> is the ſecond Place that Objects it ſelf to a Conſideration. In the eighth of Edward the third an Original Fine repreſents it to be <hi>Thomas de Garwinton's;</hi> and here many years the Poſſeſſion was reſident, till <hi>Joan</hi> his Niece, became (by Reaſon her Nephew <hi>Thomas Garwinton,</hi> Grand-child to this <hi>Thomas de Garwinton</hi> died without Iſſue) the Heir General of this Family, and ſhe being married to <hi>Richard Haut,</hi> a Cadet of the <hi>Hauts</hi> of <hi>Hautsborne, alias Biſhops-Bourne,</hi> made this, part of their Demeaſne; but this Name not long after concluding in <hi>Margery Haut,</hi> Sole Daughter and Heir to <hi>Richard Haut;</hi> ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the wife of <hi>William Iſaack</hi> of <hi>Blackmansbery</hi> in <hi>Bridge,</hi> involved this in her Husbands Revenue, to which, after it had been ſome time united, it was by Sale from this Family carried over to <hi>John Brent</hi> Eſquire: and this Name, ſome narrow Diſtance of Time after reſolving into a Daughter and Heir called <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was married to <hi>John Dering,</hi> this became part of his Eſtate, and ſo continued till his Succeſſor not long ſince ſold it to <hi>Young</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>

Eſc. Num.</hi> 23.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103337:98"/>But though this Mannor gave Sirname to <hi>Hardres;</hi> yet I find ſome others had an Intereſt in it, or at leaſt ſome part of it, before it abſolutely and ſolely came to confeſſe the Signory of this Name: <hi>Oliver de Bohun</hi> obtained a Charter of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warren to his Lands at <hi>High Hardres,</hi> in the firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, which was renued to <hi>Nicolas de Hadlow</hi> or <hi>Hallow,</hi> who had not long before purchaſed the Inheritance of the above ſaid Family at this place, in the one and twentieth year of the above mentioned Prince; but about the latter end of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, I find this Family quite diſlodged from this place, and the Sole Demeaſne and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety wrapped up in the Family of <hi>Hardres:</hi> one of whom, by Name <hi>Henry Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres,</hi> was one of the Juſtices of the Peace for this County, in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth; and from him, is deſcended Sir <hi>Richard Hardres,</hi> now Lord of this Mannor, who by a Title riveted and incorporated into him by a Chain of many uninterrupted Deſcents, does now claim the Signory of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Southcourt</hi> is another little Mannor in <hi>Upper Hardres,</hi> which in elder Times was entituled to the Propriety of <hi>Garwinton,</hi> a Family of ſignal Eſtimate and deep Root in this Track; for in an old Pedigree of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> I diſcover that <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>William de Garwinton,</hi> were in the Liſt of thoſe <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Gentlemen that accompanied <hi>Henry</hi> the third in his Expedition into <hi>Gaſcony,</hi> in the thirty ſeventh year of his Raign, which Deſign by the ill Conduct of his Affairs, and worſe Managery of his Arms, was very ruinous and full of dyſaſter, to that Prince: But this Family, about the eleventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth (as I have ſhewed in <hi>Bekesbourne</hi>) being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed without Iſſue; the Heir General brought this Mannor to be poſſeſt by <hi>Haut,</hi> from whom ſome two Deſcents after, the ſame Fatality brought it to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in whom the Propriety was reſident, until the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; and then it was conveyed to <hi>Diggs,</hi> a Family which had ſome Intereſt in it (as appears by the Book of <hi>Aid</hi>) in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and ſome Deſcents before; and from this Name not long after the ſame Alienation carried it off to <hi>Hales</hi> of the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> in which Family it hath remained ſo conſtant, that it is the inſtant propriety of Mr. ..... <hi>Hales,</hi> a yonger Branch of that Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hartlip</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Milton</hi> hath divers places of Account in it: Firſt, <hi>Gore Court,</hi> which was, in Times of an elder Aſpect, the Inheritance of a Family of that Appellation: and I find that <hi>Henry</hi> at <hi>Gore</hi> held it at his Deceaſe, in the one and thirtieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and remained with the Demeaſne of this Name, until the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and then it was tranſmitted by Sale to <hi>Werdecre</hi> or <hi>Werdegar,</hi> and here it fixt, until the ſeventeenth year of King <hi>James:</hi> and then <hi>William Werdegar,</hi> Son of <hi>George Werdegar,</hi> paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Nicholas Tufton,</hi> whoſe Son and Heir <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Thanet</hi> is now the Owner of it. <hi>Juliana de Leybourne</hi> had ſome Eſtate here at <hi>Gore Court,</hi> which, at her Deceaſe, in the three and fortieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, eſcheating with the Remainder of her Eſtate to the Crown, was by that Prince, in the fiftieth year of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſettled upon the Abby of St. <hi>Mary Grace</hi> on Tower-hill, which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore founded in the twenty fourth year of his Raign, and lay involved in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of that Cloiſter, until the general ſuppreſſion, and then it was granted by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth to <hi>William Werdegar,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor ſold it with that part of it, which was alwaies of ſecular Intereſt, to Sir <hi>Nicolas Tufton.</hi>

                  <hi>Popes-hall</hi> in this Pariſh had Owners likewiſe of that Sirname, who likewiſe were entituled to ſome Eſtate at <hi>Gaeſden</hi> in <hi>Tenterden,</hi> and continued Lords of this Seat, until the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and then it was by <hi>Richard Pope</hi> Gentleman, tranſmitted by Sale to <hi>Chriſtopher Bloer,</hi> by whoſe Daughter and Heir called <hi>Olympia Bloer,</hi> it devolved to be the Inheritance of Mr. <hi>John Tufton</hi> Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor to the Right Honorable <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Thanet,</hi> now Poſſeſſor of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ealgar</hi> or <hi>Ealdigar,</hi> now vulgarly by melting away the L, called <hi>Eager Court</hi> or <hi>Eagar Croft,</hi> was anciently, as appears by ſeveral old Deeds without Date, the Patrimony of <hi>William de Elmeſted,</hi> but continued not long in this Family; for in the thirteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, I find it folded up in the Inheritance of <hi>Roger de Northwood,</hi> and in this Name the Title was reſident until the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then it was tranſplanted by Sale into <hi>Norton</hi> of <hi>Borden,</hi> from whom
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103337:98"/>in the fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, part of it was paſſed away by Sale to <hi>Champneys,</hi> and in the eighth year of that Prince, the Remainder was by the ſame Fatality, brought to confeſſe the Signory of the above-mentioned Family, from whom, <hi>Thomas Rider,</hi> held it in Leaſe, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh; and in the ſeventeenth year of that Prince, paſſed away all his Intereſt and concernment in it to <hi>Mark Harris,</hi> but the Propriety of this place, continued ſtill in <hi>Champneys.</hi> And from him, did part of it, in the twenty fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, paſſe back again by Sale to <hi>Norton,</hi> and the Remainder in the thirty ſecond year of that King's raign, was by the ſame conveyance wholly remitted to the above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Family, and made its aboad here untill the fourth and fifth year of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> and then <hi>John Norton,</hi> by Sale conveyed his Right in it, to <hi>Gilbert Fremlin,</hi> and he in the fifteenth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> alienated all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in it, to <hi>John Palmer</hi> Eſquire, Father of Sir <hi>Anthony Palmer,</hi> and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of <hi>Dudley Palmer</hi> Eſquire, the inſtant Poſſeſſor of it.</p>
               <p>There is a Mannor in this Pariſh, vulgarly and corruptly called <hi>Grayney,</hi> but in old Deeds <hi>Graveney,</hi> as being indeed the Patrimony of a Family of that Sirname: of which Stem was <hi>Stephen de Graveney,</hi> whom, as private Record informs me, held it in the raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and in his Deſcendants, I find it ſucceſſively conſtant and fixed, untill the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth. And from that Prince's Rule, I muſt make a leap to the Government of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then I find it in the Tenure of <hi>John Mayney</hi> of <hi>Biddenden</hi> Eſquire, great Grandfather of Sir <hi>John Mayney</hi> of <hi>Linton</hi> Knight and Baronet, the preſent Lord of the Fee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hartley</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Acſtane,</hi> made up a part of that Patrimony, which came within the Circle of that Revenue, which owned for Proprietaries the Lords <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenſey,</hi> whoſe capitall Seat was at <hi>Swanſcamp,</hi> where I ſhall treat more largely of them; but it ſeems they had a ſpecial regard to this Mannor, for <hi>Warren de Montchenſey,</hi> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to <hi>Hartley</hi> in the thirty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and left it enobled and ſecured with this Franchiſe to his only Son, <hi>William de Montchenſey,</hi> who dying without Iſſue, <hi>Joan</hi> his Siſter and Heir by marching with <hi>William de Valence</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> entituled him to this Mannor, and ſhe held it at her Death, which was in the firſt year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the ſecond: from whom it devolved to her Son <hi>Aymer de Valence,</hi> who dying without Iſſue-male in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> ſecond; <hi>Iſabell de Valence</hi> his Heir Generall, united it to the Inheritance of her Husband <hi>Lawrence de Haſtings,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> from whom it came down to his Grandchild <hi>John de Haſtings.</hi> And he deceaſing without Iſſue, in the year 1389, left it to his Kinſman <hi>Reginald Grey,</hi> and he brings a pleading for this and other Land, againſt <hi>John le Scroope,</hi> in the fifteenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and in the ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, as appears by the Book of <hi>Dover</hi> in the Exchequer, he was peaceably fixed in the Poſſeſſion, and was a perſon of conſiderable Rank and importance in thoſe Times, for he bore a pair of gilt Spurs at the Coronation of the aboveſaid Prince. But no eminence of Birth or Dignity can chain the Poſſeſſion of a place to a Family, when the Title leans upon the Wheel of an inconſtant and ebbing Eſtate. For the Revolution of Sale about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, carried it from this Name to <hi>Penhale,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Penhale,</hi> as appears by the Book of <hi>Dover</hi> in the Exchequer, held it in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, but the Propriety was not long conſtant in this Family: for about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, I find it in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of <hi>Creſſell,</hi> but it was not long permanent in this Family neither: for about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, it was by Sale tranſplanted into <hi>Ballard,</hi> and here the Poſſeſſion reſted untill the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth; and then it was alienated to <hi>William Sydley</hi> Eſquire, Anceſtor to Sir <hi>Charles Sydley</hi> Baronet, who now is entituled to the Right and Propriety of it.</p>

                  <hi>Hawking</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Folkstone</hi> contains two little Mannors within its Verge, which muſt not be paſſed over in Silence. The firſt is <hi>Bilcheſter,</hi> which belonged to the Knights Templers, but upon their Suppreſſion, in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, it eſcheated to the Crown, and remained there untill new proviſion was made, by the Statute called <hi>Statutum de Terris Templariorum,</hi> paſſed in the ſeventeenth year of the aboveſaid Prince, to enſtate it on the Knights Hoſpitalers, and make it part of their Revenue, and accordingly was united to their Patrimony, nor was any hand ſo bold as to tear it off; untill the generall Suppreſſion of this Order, in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, did inveſt it in the Crown: and that Prince in the thirty third year of his Reign granted it to Sir <hi>Anthony Aucher</hi> in Leaſe: and he not long after, aſſigned it to <hi>Thomas Sommerſall,</hi> by whom it was made over to <hi>Richard Simonds,</hi> but the Fee-ſimple continued in the Crown, untill the year 1648.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is <hi>Fleggs Court,</hi> which was folded up in that Demeaſne, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Abby of St. <hi>Radigunds,</hi> and upon the Suppreſſion of that Cloiſter, was exchanged by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his Reign, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lands with <hi>Thomas Cranmer</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and ſo remained free from violation, untill theſe Times wrapt it up in the Demeaſne of that See.</p>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103337:99"/>which Prince, upon its eſcheating to the Crown, granted it in the thirty ſixth year of his Government, to Sir <hi>Anthony Aucher.</hi> And he, in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Walter Henley,</hi> by whoſe Daughter and Coheir it came to <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> of <hi>Bedgebury</hi> Eſquire; who in the ſixth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, conveyed it to <hi>Chriſtopher Sackvill</hi> Eſquire, from which Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Grand-fathers Remembrance it came over by Sale to <hi>Franklin;</hi> and his Succeſſor <hi>George Franklin</hi> dying without Iſſue, bequeathed it by Teſtament to his Kinſman Sir <hi>William Sydley,</hi> whoſe Grand-child Sir <hi>Charles Sydley</hi> Baronet, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled to the inſtant Fee-ſimple of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kents Chauntry</hi> is a ſecond Place of Account in <hi>Headcorne,</hi> called ſo becauſe here was a <hi>Chauntry</hi> founded by one <hi>John Kent,</hi> in the ſixth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and a large Demeaſne ſettled upon it, to ſupport the <hi>Chauntry</hi> Prieſt that was to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate there; all which upon the ſuppreſſion was in the two and thirtieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, granted to Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leger,</hi> whoſe Son Sir <hi>Warham St. Leger,</hi> about the Beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> paſſed it away by Sale to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resford</hi> of <hi>Weſternham,</hi> from which Family in our Memory it went away to <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and he very lately hath alienated it to Mr. ...... <hi>Belcher,</hi> now Miniſter of Gods Word at <hi>Ulcombe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Kelſham</hi> is a third Seat in this Pariſh, which may challenge our Conſideration; becauſe it was the Reſidence formerly (though now transformed into a Farm-houſe) of Gentlemen known by this Sirname, who might have been ranged and marſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led amongſt the prime Gentlemen of this County, and bare for their Coat-<hi>Armour Sable,</hi> a <hi>Feſſe</hi> engrailed <hi>Argent,</hi> between three <hi>Garbes, Or.</hi> One of them ſtood depicted in coloured Glaſſe in the Church windows, with his <hi>Arms</hi> upon his <hi>Tabard;</hi> but by the Aſſaults of Age, and other wild and ſacrilegious Impreſſions, is now utterly defaced and demoliſhed; nor is the Family in any better condition, that having many years ſince deſerted the Poſſeſſion of this Place; for about the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> it was conveyed to <hi>Johnſon:</hi> from whom very lately, it is come over by Purchaſe to <hi>Stringer.</hi>

                  <hi>Riſhford</hi> is a fourth Mannor circumſcribed within the Bounds of <hi>Headcorne,</hi> which in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, was poſſeſt by a Family called <hi>Pend,</hi> who (as it appears by the Book of <hi>Aid</hi>) paid a reſpective ſupply for it, at making the Black Prince Knight. And here is much Land in this Pariſh, which bears the Name of <hi>Pend,</hi> a probable Argument of the Antiquity of it in this Track: nor did it yeild to Time, or deſert the Poſſeſſion of this Place, but was conſtant in the Tenure of it, until that Age we call our Grand-fathers, and then it was alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to a Family called <hi>Dominie, alias Fullaker;</hi> the laſt of which Name at this Place was <hi>Chriſtopher Dominie, alias Fullaker,</hi> who not many years ſince paſſed it away to Mr. <hi>John Hulks</hi> of <hi>Newenham,</hi> whoſe Son and Heir Mr. <hi>Stephen Hulks,</hi> does now poſſeſſe the Signory of it.</p>

                  <hi>Herietſham</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Eyhorne,</hi> was anciently a Limb of that Eſtate which was entituled to the Poſſeſſion of the Noble Family of <hi>Creſcy: Hugh de Creſcy</hi> died ſeiſed of the Mannor, in the forty ſeventh year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and his Grand-mother <hi>Margery</hi> was Daughter of <hi>William de Cheyney</hi> of <hi>Patricks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne Cheyney,</hi> as appears <hi>Clauſ.</hi> 52. <hi>Henrici tertii Memb.</hi> 6. <hi>in Dorſo.</hi> But he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed without Iſſue, and ſo his Brother <hi>Stephen de Creſcy</hi> became his Heir and Lord of <hi>Herietſham,</hi> and in this Family it continued until the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and then the Poſſeſſion of this Place went from <hi>Creſcy</hi> into <hi>Northwood,</hi> as is manifeſt by the Book of <hi>Aid,</hi> where <hi>Roger de Northwood</hi> is repreſented to have held this Mannor, and have paid a proportionate <hi>Aid</hi> for it, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and he deceaſed ſeiſed of it in the thirty fifth year of that King's Raign. And in this Name it remained fixed until the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and then it was tranſplanted into the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of a Family called <hi>Adam,</hi> who had large Poſſeſſions in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and bore for their Paternal Coat vert, a <hi>Plain Croſſe, Or;</hi> and <hi>John Adam</hi> held it at his Death, which was in the ninteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and left it to his Son <hi>John Adam;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whom I do not find any more of the Family poſſeſt of it: for in the Raign of

                  <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, I diſcover by ſome Court Rols that <hi>James Peckham</hi> of <hi>Yaldham</hi> Eſquire, was Lord of the Fee; and <hi>Reginald Peckham</hi> his Son, that was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the laſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, kept his Shrivalty at <hi>Herietſham;</hi> but after this, it was of no long continuance in this Family; for in the fifteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, <hi>Reginald Peckham</hi> paſſes it away by Sale to <hi>Edward Scott</hi> Eſquire, and he not long after tranſmits it by the ſame conveyance to <hi>John Hales</hi> one of the Barons of the Exchequer, and from him one Moiety of it went away by Sale, in the twenty eighth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, to <hi>John Norton</hi> Eſquire; and the other not long after to Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leger. Norton</hi> conveyed his proportion to <hi>Aſhburnham</hi> of <hi>Suſſex;</hi> and both <hi>St. Leger</hi> and <hi>Aſhburnham,</hi> in the Time almoſt of our Fathers Remembrance, by a concurrent Sale demiſed their joint Right in it to Sir <hi>John Steed,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor, Doctour ...... <hi>Steed,</hi> Doctour of the Civil Law, is the inſtant Proprietary of <hi>Herietſham.</hi>

                  <hi>Eaſt Farbon</hi> and <hi>Bentley,</hi> are two little Mannors in this Pariſh, which belonged to the Priory of <hi>Leeds;</hi> and upon the ſuppreſſion, were made parcel of the Revenue of the Crown, and remained there until King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, in the fourth year of his Raign, granted them to Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leger,</hi> whoſe great Grand-child Sir <hi>Warham St. Leger,</hi> about the Beginning of King <hi>James,</hi> paſſed them away to Mr. ........ <hi>Steed,</hi> Father to Doctour <hi>Steed;</hi> who upon the Deceaſe of his Nephew <hi>Cromer Steed</hi> without Iſſue Male, as Reverſioner in Entail, is now ſettled in the Poſſeſſion of theſe two Mannors.</p>

                  <hi>Weſt Farbon,</hi> ſometimes in old Deeds, called little <hi>Herietſham,</hi> lies likewiſe in this Pariſh, and was granted in the two and fiftieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, to <hi>William de Valentia,</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrooke:</hi> But after him I track no more of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at this place; For in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight, it was held by <hi>John Pennington;</hi> and in the fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, when <hi>Blanch</hi> that Prince's Daughter was married, it acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it ſelf to be under the Signory of the above mentioned Family, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued divers years after united to their Intereſt: But in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, I find them quite vaniſhed from the Poſſeſſion, and a Family called <hi>Hede</hi> or <hi>Head,</hi> entituled to the Inheritance; and in this Name did it make its abode, until the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and then it was conveyed by Sale to <hi>St. Leger,</hi> where it reſted until the Beginning of King <hi>James,</hi> and then it was alienated by Sir <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham St. Leger</hi> to Mr. <hi>Benedict Barneham,</hi> who left four Daughters and Co-heirs, matched to <hi>Audley, Conſtable, Doble,</hi> and <hi>Soame,</hi> who equally ſhared his Eſtate; and this upon the diſtinguiſhing of it into juſt Proportions, augmented the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of <hi>Conſtable.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Harbilton</hi> is another ancient Mannor in <hi>Herietſham;</hi> It was, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, the Inheritance of <hi>Thomas de Malmains;</hi> for at that Time, as appears by the Book of <hi>Aid,</hi> he paid a ſubſidiary ſupply for this and other Lands, at making the Black Prince Knight. After this Family was mouldred away, which was before the End of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, I find the Family of <hi>Maris</hi> was ſettled in the Inheritance. <hi>William Maris</hi> who was Eſquire, firſt to <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and after to Cardinal <hi>Kempe,</hi> was Poſſeſſor of it, and ſo was his Son <hi>William Maris</hi> Eſquire, who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the one and twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth.

                  <hi>Hernehill</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Boughton,</hi> has two Places in it, which may make it remarkable: Firſt, <hi>Durgall Stroude,</hi> which was, in Times of higher Track, the <hi>Martin's</hi> a very noble and illuſtrious Family in this Territory, whoſe capital or principal Seat was at <hi>Graveney,</hi> not far diſtant: and here, after it had flouriſht, by the Decurſion of ſome Ages, it fell into a Daughter and Heir, called <hi>Margaret,</hi> Sole Daughter and Heir to <hi>Matthew Martin,</hi> who was married to <hi>William Norton</hi> of <hi>Cokeſdiſh</hi> in <hi>Feverſham,</hi> and in her Right did he become Proprietary of this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, from whoſe Heir <hi>Thomas Norton,</hi> the Property or Fee-ſimple was by Sale tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred into the Poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>John Wild</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to whoſe Heirs General the Propriety of this Mannor does at preſent relate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is another Seat in this Pariſh, vulgarly called <hi>Apes Court, alias Lockley;</hi> but, indeed, in truer Orthography writ <hi>Epes-Court,</hi> a place ſo deſpicable, that it had not been worth the Memoriall, but that in all the circumſtances of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability the <hi>Epes</hi>'s of <hi>Canterbury</hi> aſſumed, if not Seat, yet at leaſt Sirname from thence; and it is the more poſſible, becauſe the <hi>Epes's</hi> have been ancient Tenants to the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for the Mannor of <hi>Seas-alter,</hi> divided by a neer Diſtance from this place; in Ages of a more modern Date, the <hi>Nevinſons</hi> were the Lords of the Fee, and certainly this was their ancient Manſion, before they were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted to <hi>Eaſtry;</hi> this being ſold in the Raign of King <hi>James</hi> by Sir <hi>Roger Nevinſon</hi> to Sir <hi>John Wild</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in whoſe Heirs General (<hi>Dudley Wild</hi> Eſquire, his only ſurviving Son being lately deceaſed without Iſſue) the Poſſeſſion continues fixed.</p>

And he concluding in <hi>Alice Scott,</hi> a Female Inheritrix, ſhe by matching with <hi>William Kempe,</hi> Nephew of Cardinal <hi>Kempe,</hi> linked it to the Demeaſne of that Family, and here it remained until Sir <hi>William Kempe,</hi> about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, alienated it to <hi>Browning,</hi> from which Family, about the Beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it paſſed away by Sale to Mr. <hi>Robert Edolph,</hi> whoſe Grand-child Mr. <hi>Robert Edolph</hi> dying in the year 1632. without Iſſue, gave his Intereſt in it with <hi>Godchepes</hi> to his beloved Wife: <hi>Cicelie Edolph</hi> remarried to Sir <hi>Francis Knowls</hi> of <hi>Reading,</hi> and ſhe paſſed away the Moiety of it (the other proportion of it being inveſted in Mr. <hi>Thomas Edolph</hi> the third Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) with <hi>Godchepes,</hi> now called <hi>Goodchepes,</hi> to her Husbands ſecond Brother, Mr. <hi>Samuel Edolph,</hi> who ſome few years ſince conveyed his Intereſt in <hi>Hinxhill</hi> with

               <p>
                  <hi>W. liham</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Hinxhill,</hi> which was folded up in the vaſt Demeaſne of <hi>Crioll,</hi> by whoſe Daughter and Heir it came to <hi>Rokeſley,</hi> and by the Female In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritrix of <hi>Rokeſley</hi> to <hi>Poynings:</hi> in which Name it continued until the twelfth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then Sir <hi>Edward Poynings</hi> dying without any lawful Iſſue; after a ſignal and ſolemne Inſpection, by ſeveral Inquiſitions into his colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Alliance, no Claim being laid unto his Eſtate, this Mannor eſcheated to the Crown, in the fourteenth year of that Prince, and then King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, by Grant paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Richard Damſell,</hi> who not long after tranſmitted his Right in it to <hi>Goldhill,</hi> who in our Grand-fathers Memory alienated it to Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Edolph,</hi> whoſe Grand-child Mr. <hi>Robert Edolph</hi> gave it with his Intereſt in <hi>Hinx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill</hi> and <hi>Goodchepes</hi> to his Wife <hi>Cicelie Edolph,</hi> who paſſed away the Moiety to Mr. <hi>Samuel Edolph,</hi> and he deviſed it by Will to Mr. <hi>Angell,</hi> who hath transferred his Right in it by Sale to Mr. <hi>Edward Chowte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Farm called <hi>Godchepes</hi> or <hi>Goodchepes,</hi> in this Pariſh; for an unbroken Series of many Generations had Owners of that Sirname, as appears by an Inquiſition taken after the Death of <hi>Thomas Godchepe,</hi> in the one and thirtieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc.

It pleaſed the eternal Arbiter of humane Affairs, ſo to order the viciſſitude of things that thoſe eight Perſons recited in the Deed, deceaſed without Iſſue; ſo that his Eſtate here at <hi>Godchepe</hi> devolved to <hi>Barrow,</hi> as his Heir at Law, from whom by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his eldeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Co-heir, it came to Mr. <hi>Robert Edolph.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hoo</hi> gives Name to the Hundred wherein it is ſituated, and was a principal Branch of that Revenue, which fell under the Dominion of <hi>Bardolfe: Robert de Bardolfe</hi> held it under the Notion of a whole Knights Fee, as appears by the red Book kept in the Exchequer, in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond: and from him it came down to <hi>Hugh Bardolfe,</hi> who was rated for it after the ſame Account, in the ſecond year of <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt; but <hi>Hugh</hi> Lord <hi>Bardolfe</hi> his Son, not long after concluded in three Daughters and Co-heirs. <hi>Mawde</hi> was matched to <hi>Nicholas Points, Margaret</hi> was married to <hi>Robert Aguillon,</hi> and <hi>Iſolda</hi> was eſpouſed to <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> which divided the Inheritance of that Family at this Place. But that Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it which was annexed by this Alliance to <hi>Points</hi> and <hi>Aguillon,</hi> was paſſed away by a Joint Sale to <hi>John de la Pole,</hi> and he paid reſpective ſupply for his Lands at <hi>Hoo,</hi> which were rated at half a Knights Fee, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; but before the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth; this Family was worn out, and that Eſtate they held here was by Purchaſe involved and ſwallowed up in the Inheritance of <hi>Grey,</hi> who before was entituled to the Moiety of this Mannor, as deſcending from <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Codnor</hi> and <hi>Iſolda</hi> his Wife, Co-heir to <hi>Hugh</hi> Lord <hi>Bardolfe,</hi> and in this Family did it continue until <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Codnor,</hi> in the twenty ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Iſſue Male, left it to be Patrimony of Daughters and Co-heirs, one of which brought it to be the Inheritance of the Lord <hi>Zouch;</hi> but in this Family it had not long remained, when <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Zouch</hi> having purſued the Intereſt of the Houſe of <hi>Yorke,</hi> did exemplifie his Zeal to it, by his being embarked in the Cauſe and Quarrel of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, in that ſignal and fatal Encounter at <hi>Boſworth</hi> Feild,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103337:102"/>where the Title of the two Houſes <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> was put to the bloody Arbitration of the Sword; for which, after the Crown and Scepter by that happy Conteſt devolved to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, he was in the firſt year of that Prince's Rule attainted, and his Eſtate here granted to Sir <hi>Henry Wiatt,</hi> one of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to the ſaid Monarch, whoſe infortunate Grand-child Sir <hi>Thomas Wiatt,</hi> being likewiſe attainted in the ſecond year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> it eſcheated, upon that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation, to the Crown, and there was lodged until King <hi>James,</hi> about the third year of his Raign granted it to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> ſold it <hi>quarto Caroli</hi> to Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> Knight and Baronet; from whom it is now come down to his Grand-child, Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> Baronet, in whoſe Revenue, it, at this inſtant, is involved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beluncle</hi> is another Seat in this Pariſh, whoſe Antiquity pleads for a Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: the firſt Family whom I find in Record to have been poſſeſt of it was <hi>Foliot. Jordan de Foliot</hi> held it in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, by the fifth part of a Knights Fee; and from him did it deſcend to <hi>Richard de Foliot,</hi> his Son and Heir, who in the twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, paſſes it away by Fine to <hi>Reginald de Cobham,</hi> who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> from the thirty third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, to the fortieth of that Prince, and was accounted one of the principal Seats which was couched in the Demeaſne of this Family; and, in divers old Pedigrees and other Deeds, they are written <hi>Cobham</hi> of <hi>Beluncle.</hi> Of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was <hi>Henry de Cobham,</hi> who was ſummoned to Parliament as Baron, in the ſeventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third: <hi>Stephen de Cobham,</hi> who was ſummoned in the eighteenth year of that Prince: And <hi>Thomas de Cobham,</hi> who was ſummoned as Baron, in the thirty eighth year of that Prince. And in <hi>Cobham,</hi> and then <hi>Brook,</hi> did it continue, until <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> and his Brother <hi>George Brooke,</hi> in the firſt year of King <hi>James,</hi> being entangled in that cloudy Deſign of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues muffled up in a Miſt until this Day, forfeited both their Eſtates, and the laſt his Life. But King <hi>James</hi> reſtored this to <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> who dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue it devolved to Sir <hi>William Brooke</hi> Son of <hi>George Brooke,</hi> and he likewiſe deceaſing without Iſſue-male, in the year 1643. it came over to Sir <hi>John Brooke,</hi> now Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> as Reverſioner in Entail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hollingbourne</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Eyhorne,</hi> was given to the Monks of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for to ſupply them with Diet, by <hi>Athelſtan</hi> Son of <hi>Ethelred,</hi> which Mannor he had before purchaſed of his Father; and in the year 909. with his Licence and Conſent beſtowed it on that Covent, free as <hi>Adiſham.</hi> If you will diſcover how it was rated in the Conquerors Time, Doomeſday Book thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it to you, <hi>Hollingbourne</hi> (ſaies that) <hi>eſt Mancrium Monachorum, &amp; de Cibo corum &amp; in Tempore Edwardi Regis ſe defendebat pro</hi> VI. <hi>Sullings, &amp; nunc ſimiliter.

               </p>
               <p>There was the Gallows which appertained to the Priory of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> here erected at <hi>Hollingbourne,</hi> where thoſe who had committed Murders, Felonies, or other Treſpaſſes worthy of death, within the liberties of that Covent, were accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their priviledge of <hi>Infangtheof</hi> and <hi>Outfangtheof,</hi> brought to exemplary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: See <hi>Somner Fol.</hi> 286.</p>
               <p>There is a Mannor in this Pariſh called <hi>Ripple,</hi> which had Owners of that Name; for in the thirtieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 91. I find that <hi>Richard de Ripple</hi> held this, and other Lands, which he had in Leaſe from the Priory of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> at his Deceaſe, but it only gave him Sirname, and then left his Family; for before the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, it went from this Name to Sir <hi>William Septuans,</hi> and he enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the forty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; and tranſmitted it to his Son <hi>William Septuans,</hi> who not long after conveyed it to <hi>John Gower,</hi> in which Name it lay couched until the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth; and then it was alienated to <hi>Brockhull,</hi> a Cadet of that Stock which
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103337:102"/>flouriſhed ſo long at <hi>Calehill,</hi> and here it continued for many Deſcents in this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, until the Beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> and then <hi>Henry Brockhull</hi> dying without Iſſue-male, <hi>Anne</hi> his only Daughter and Heir brought it to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Sir <hi>John Taylor,</hi> in which Family after it had lodged only until the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was paſſed away to Sir <hi>Martin Barnham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elnothington</hi> is another Mannor in this Pariſh, which had Owners likewiſe of that Sirname; for in a Deed of <hi>Adam de Twiſdens,</hi> which bears Date from the one and twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, one <hi>William de Elnothington</hi> is Witneſs: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this man, I find no more mention in any Record of the Name: In the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, I diſcover Sir <hi>Arnold St. Leger</hi> of <hi>Ulcombe</hi> to be poſſeſt of it, and in the forty ſecond year he makes a Compoſition with divers of his Tenants for Lands that they held of this Mannor, and from him like an uninterrupted Thread, did the Title of this place paſſe thorough many Deſcents of this Family, until at laſt it devolved to Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leger,</hi> who almoſt in our Memory alienated it to Sir <hi>Thomas Colepeper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pen-Court</hi> is another Seat in <hi>Hollingbourne</hi> worthy our Notice. It was in elder Times the Patrimony of a Family called <hi>Pen;</hi> but whether the <hi>Pens</hi> of <hi>Codcot</hi> in the County of <hi>Bedford,</hi> were deſcended from them or not, is uncertain; in Brief, before the end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, this Family was worn out, and then the <hi>Donets</hi> ſucceeded, but held this Seat not long: for by the Heir Generall it devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with much other Land to <hi>St. Leger</hi> of <hi>Ulcombe,</hi> and here it reſted untill all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt our Remembrance: and then it was paſſed away to Sir <hi>Thomas Colepeper;</hi> and he again conveyed it to Mr. <hi>Mark Queſtwood</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who, upon his Deceaſe, ſettled it for ever on the Company of Fiſhmongers in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muſton</hi> is likewiſe within the Verge of this Pariſh: upon peruſall of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Deeds and Court-rols, I found it to be written <hi>Moſton,</hi> as giving Name, in the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, to a Family of that Appellation, which about the Beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, was wholly crumbled away, and had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred the Poſſeſſion to <hi>Wood,</hi> in which Family the Inheritance hath ever ſince been permanent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Greenway-court,</hi> is the laſt place conſiderable in this Pariſh; It was as high as the Conduct of any Evidence can guide me to diſcover, parcell of the Patrimony of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeze,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Atleeze,</hi> dying without Iſſue, in the year 1394, gave it to his Brother <hi>Marcellus Atleeze,</hi> by whoſe Daughter and Coheir, it came to be poſſeſt by <hi>Valentine Barret</hi> of <hi>Pery-Court;</hi> and he, about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, conveyed it to <hi>Fitz Water,</hi> in which Family it remained, untill the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth; and then it was alienated to <hi>St. Leger,</hi> with whoſe Inheritance it continued, untill almoſt our Age; and then it was by Sale tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into Sir <hi>Alexander Colepeper,</hi> who upon his Deceaſe, gave it to Sir <hi>John Colepeper</hi> of <hi>Loſenham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hope</hi> in the Hundreds of <hi>Langport</hi> and St. <hi>Martins,</hi> hath nothing memorable in it but <hi>Crawthorn,</hi> which for thoſe worthy perſons, who have ſucceſſively held it, calls for ſome Memorial; for firſt, the <hi>Cheyneys</hi> were (as appears by ancient Evidences) Lords of the Fee: and when they went out, the <hi>Henleys</hi> about the latter end of <hi>Hen.</hi> the eighth, were the next eminent Poſſeſſors of it: and in the Deſcendants of this Family, did the propriety reſide, untill the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and then it was alienated to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Borough</hi> of <hi>Sterborough,</hi> who not long after conveyed it to <hi>Tooke,</hi> of <hi>Bere</hi> in <hi>Weſtcliffe,</hi> from whom it came over to Mr. <hi>Charles Took</hi> of <hi>Bere,</hi> and he hath lately, by the Viciſſitude of Sale, tranſplanted his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in it, to his Nephew Mr. <hi>Edward Chowte,</hi> who being lately deceaſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue-male, hath ſetled it on his only Brother Mr. <hi>George Chowte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Higham</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Shamell,</hi> had anciently a Nunnery: but the original Chartularies, and other Records being loſt, the Founder is unknown. King <hi>Hen.</hi> the third, by a Charter of Inſpection, as appears <hi>Carta</hi> 11. <hi>parte ſecunda, Memb. ſeptima,</hi> reviews the Liberties of this Cloiſter, and confirms them, and adds this Franchiſe or Immunity to the former, that this Pariſh lying couched in their
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103337:103"/>Demeaſn, ſhould hold a Fair on <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Day, and two days after. This Mannor, upon the Suppreſſion, was by the Bounty of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth enſtated for ever on St. <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge, in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and there at preſent it continues.</p>
               <p>The places of moſt eminence, which were of ſecular Intereſt, are <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Little Okeley,</hi> which both were formerly united, though ſince diſſever'd and pluck'd aſunder by Sale. In the twentieth of <hi>Ed.</hi> the third, I find them wrapt up in the Poſſeſſions of <hi>John de St. Clere,</hi> who held them by the fourth part of a Knights Fee, of the Honor of <hi>Montchenſey,</hi> that is of <hi>Swanſcamp-Caſtle,</hi> from whoſe Deſcendant, about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, they were both paſſed away to <hi>Neile</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, conveyed <hi>Great Okeley</hi> to <hi>John Sydley</hi> Eſquire, Anceſtor to Sir <hi>Charles Sydley</hi> Baronet, the inſtant Inheritor of it. But little <hi>Okeley</hi> by the ſame Tranſmiſſion was transferred to <hi>Colemeley</hi> or <hi>Cholmeley,</hi> who about the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> reſigned up his Intereſt by Sale to <hi>Thompſon,</hi> from whom the ordinary Viciſſitude of purchaſe not long ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the Title down to <hi>Beſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Merſton</hi> was formerly an independent Pariſh of it ſelf, though ſince annexed to <hi>Higham,</hi> and had a Church dedicated to St. <hi>Giles,</hi> whoſe Ruines, in deſpight of the Impreſſions of Age, yet repreſent themſelves to the ſmalleſt Glance of a curious Eye. It was, before it fell into this Darkneſs and Obſcurity, made ſomething il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious by being the Inheritance of <hi>John de St. Clere:</hi> and when this Family found its Tomb, the Name of <hi>Smith</hi> Stept in, and roſe upon its Ruines. And when this was expired at this place, which was about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, <hi>Jordan</hi> put in his Claim to the Poſſeſſion of it; but about the latter end of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Prince, I find this Family extinguiſhed, becauſe the propriety of this Mannor was by one of the above mentioned Names conveyed to <hi>Anthony Tutſham,</hi> who not long after alienated the premiſes to <hi>George Brooke</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham;</hi> from whom, by deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant Right, the Intereſt of it is devolved to Sir <hi>John Brooke,</hi> reſtored to the Barony of <hi>Cobham</hi> by the late King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> who now poſſeſſes this place as Reverſioner in Entail to Sir <hi>William Brooke,</hi> who dyed without Iſſue-male in the year 1643.</p>

                  <hi>Horſmonden</hi> in the Hundreds of <hi>Brenchley, Horſmonden,</hi> and <hi>Larkefeild,</hi> was folded up in the Patrimony of <hi>Rokeſley,</hi> a Family of a large Revenne, and as wide a Repute in this Track, from whom it deſcended to <hi>Richard de Rokeſley,</hi> by whoſe Inheritrix it was linked to the Patrimony of <hi>Thomas de Poynings,</hi> from whom by the ſteps of divers Deſcents it went down to Sir <hi>Edward Poynings,</hi> who deceaſing without any lawfull Iſſue, in the twelfth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: and there being not any that could by a pretence of collateral Alliance entitle themſelves to his Eſtate, the Crown made it its own Intereſt by Eſcheat, and then the above ſaid Prince, in the thirty ſixth of his Raign, granted it to <hi>Richard Darell:</hi> and his Son <hi>George Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,</hi> in the tenth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> conveyed it to <hi>Richard Paine,</hi> who not long after alienated it to <hi>Beſwick,</hi> Anceſtor to Mrs. <hi>Mary Beſwick,</hi> who dying without Iſſue, hath ſettled it by Teſtament for life on Mr. ...... <hi>Haughton.</hi>

                  <hi>Reynolds</hi> is a third place of conſiderable importance; it was the Seat of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that Denomination, and were rooted by a Preſcription of ſo many years in the Poſſeſſion of this Place, that it is a Controverſie, whether thoſe at <hi>Belſo</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> or theſe here, were of the moſt venerable Antiquity; one of them in one

               <p>There was an eager Conteſt between <hi>John Beckford</hi> Vicar of <hi>Chartham,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher Shukborough</hi> Eſquire, Lord of <hi>Horton,</hi> touching the celebration of Divine Offices in the Chappel at <hi>Horton;</hi> as likewiſe the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments: and it was improved to that Animoſity, that there was a mutual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal made to <hi>William Courtney,</hi> then Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who directed a Commiſſion to <hi>John Barnett</hi> his Official, in the year 1380. to hear and determine the Controverſie, and upon a ſerious ſifting and winnowing this whole Affair, the Debate was wound up upon this Concluſion, that there ſhould be a ſolemnization of all Divine Offices in the above mentioned Chappel, <hi>exceptis tantum D. functorum Sepulturis &amp; exſequiis,</hi> only the Dead were to receive their enterment in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chartham.</hi>

                  <hi>Hothfeild</hi> in the Hundreds of <hi>Chart, Longbridge,</hi> and <hi>Cale-hill,</hi> was wrapt up in the Demeaſne of the Lord <hi>Badeleſmer,</hi> who held it in Grand Serjeanty of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> that is, he was to ſerve up water to the Arch-biſhop at his Inſtallment or Inthronization to waſh his Hands, and had <hi>Pelvim &amp; Lotorium;</hi> ſo are the Words of the Record: he was rewarded with the Veſſel which contained the Water, and likewiſe the Towel which dried his Hands, and he was likewiſe to be his Chamberlin the Night of his Inſtalment, and was recompenſed with the Arch-biſhops Bed, as his Guerdon. <hi>Bartholomew de Badeleſmere</hi> Son of <hi>Guncelin,</hi> died poſſeſt of it, in the fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Rot.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103337:105"/>Aſſociation with the Rebellious Nobility, having in the ſixteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, forfeited this to the Crown; it lay entwined with the Royal Revenue, until <hi>Edward</hi> the third, in the ſecond year of his Raign, reſtored it to his Son <hi>Bartholomew de Badeleſmere,</hi> who in the twelfth year of that Prince's Government, dying without Iſſue, his four Siſters became his Co-heirs, whereof <hi>Margaret</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Lord <hi>William Roſſe</hi> of <hi>Hamlake,</hi> caſt this Mannor into the Inheritance of that Family, and he in her Right died ſeiſed of it, in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot.

This I mention, the rather, becauſe divers of our Chronicles, have erroneouſly mentioned, that he was an Attorney, whom this Prince pardoned for Forgery. But to proceed: After the Deceaſe of Sir <hi>John Fogge,</hi> who dyed in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, it returned to the Crown, and lay there untill <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, granted it to <hi>John Tufton</hi> Eſquire, Anceſtor to the right honorable <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Thanet,</hi> who now by paternal Right, claims the Poſſeſſion of it.</p>

                  <hi>Swinfort</hi> is a Mannor in <hi>Hothfield,</hi> which afforded a Sirname to a Family ſo called: but whether Sir <hi>Otho Swinfort,</hi> Husband to <hi>Katharine Swinfort,</hi> who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Concubine to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> was extracted from this Family or not, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; becauſe I cannot diſcover they were ever of any Eminence.

                  <hi>Fauleſley,</hi> vulgarly now called <hi>Fauſley</hi> and <hi>Fouſley,</hi> was the Patrimony of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which borrowed not only its Source and Extraction, but its Denomination likewiſe from hence. Sir <hi>John Fauleſley,</hi> was an eminent perſon, in the Raign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, being frequently in his Time, as appears by the late printed Abridgement of the Records in the Tower, ſummoned to ſit in Parliament as Baron: but although this Family was made eminent by this worthy perſon, who was an elder Branch of this Stem; yet in ſucceeding Generations it began to crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble away, into Obſcurity and Decay: and was at laſt ground to ſo narrow a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Eſtate, that about the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> this Mannor, which had ſo long been eſpouſed to the Intereſt of this Name and Family, was carried off by Sale to <hi>Drury;</hi> in which Family it was reſident, untill the latter end of that Princeſſe, and then it was alienated to <hi>Paris;</hi> who immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conveyed it to <hi>Bull;</hi> and he tranſplanted his Right by Sale again into the ſame Family; from whom, a like Viciſſitude brought it to be the Inheritance of Sir <hi>Nicholas Tufton,</hi> Father to the right honorable <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Thanet</hi> now Poſſeſſor of it.</p>

From the Heir Generall of this Family, is Mr. <hi>George Brown</hi> Eſquire, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Spelmonden</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and now of <hi>Buckland</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> by his Grand-mother originally deſcended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hougham</hi> in the Hundreds of <hi>Bew borough</hi> and <hi>Folkstone</hi> gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of as reverend an Eſtimate for Antiquity, as any in this Track. <hi>Robert de Hougham,</hi> dyed ſeiſed of it, in the forty firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and left it to his Son
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>This</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert de Hougham <hi>was with</hi> Edw. <hi>the firſt, at the Seige of</hi> Acon <hi>in</hi> Paleſtine.</note> 
                  <hi>Robert de Hougham,</hi> who was Caſtellan of <hi>Rocheſter Caſtle,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and dyed ſeiſed in the poſſeſſion of this, and the Cuſtody of that, in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 14. But in the next Deſcent, this Family was entombed in two Daughters and Coheirs, one was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>John de Shelving,</hi> and the other to <hi>Waretius de Valoigns,</hi> who in her Right entered upon the Inheritance, and in the fourteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <hi>Hougham,</hi> but enjoyed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his new acquired Priviledge or Inheritance long; for before the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, he dyed, and left a large Inheritance to be ſhared by his two Daughters and Coheirs, one whereof was wedded to Sir <hi>Thomas Fogge</hi> of <hi>Toniford,</hi> and the other to <hi>Thomas de Aldon,</hi> to whoſe Revenue upon the Partition, this was annexed, and he was found in the enjoyment of it at his Death, which was in the thirty fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc.

               <p>
                  <hi>Little Hougham,</hi> is a ſecond Mannor in this Pariſh: It was, in Ages of a very high Aſcent, the Revenue of the ancient Family of <hi>Baſing. William de Baſing,</hi> held it at his Death, which was in the ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 21. From whom it deſceuded to his Grandchild <hi>John Baſing,</hi> who dyed in the Tenure of it, in the ſeventh year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 6. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whoſe Deceaſe, it continued in the Name, untill the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then it was alienated to <hi>Clive,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Cliffe,</hi> a Family of eminent Account, in the Counties of <hi>Salop</hi> and <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and in the Poſſeſſion of this Family it dwelt, untill the latter end of that Prince, and then by Purchaſe, it was made the Patrimony of <hi>Hextall,</hi> a Eamily who extracted their original, out of <hi>Staffordſhire;</hi> and here it reſided, untill the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and then it was tranſmitted by a Daughter and Heir to <hi>Whetenhall;</hi> who ſold it to <hi>John Bois</hi> Eſquire, Anceſtor to <hi>Jo. Bois</hi> of <hi>Fredville</hi> Eſquire, who is entituled to the preſent Signiory of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maxton</hi> is a third place, which muſt not be waved in this Diſcourſe: It was in elder Times divided between two Families called <hi>Madekin,</hi> and <hi>Walſham. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen de Madekin,</hi> was not only Lord of <hi>Madekin</hi> in <hi>Denton,</hi> and the Moiety of this place, in the year one thouſand ſeventy and ſeven, but likewiſe Land at <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> as appears by Mr. <hi>Sompner,</hi> in his Survey of that City, page 415. And <hi>Will. de Walſham,</hi> who in the thirty ſeventh year, was poſſeſt of the other Moiety of this place gave, about that year by Charter, ſome land to the Incumbent or Parſon of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> of <hi>Harbledown.</hi> After theſe two Families had deſerted the Inheritance, I find the <hi>Archers,</hi> about the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, to be entituled by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe to it, and <hi>William le Archer</hi> (ſo he is written in the Book of <hi>Aid</hi>) paid an Auxiliary Supply for this Mannor, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, at
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103337:106"/>making the Black Prince Knight; but his Son <hi>VVilliam Archer,</hi> in the twenty firſt year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, paſſes away his Right by Sale to <hi>John Alkham</hi> of <hi>Alk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> a Family that had taken deep Root in Antiquity downwards, and had a ſpreading Revenue upwards in this Track; but, before the end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, were conſumed and crumbled away, and then the next Family which ſucceeded in the Poſſeſſion was <hi>Herman,</hi> who was likewiſe owner of <hi>Mary-place</hi> in <hi>Crayford,</hi> and in this Name did the Intereſt of it fix, until the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and then it was alienated to <hi>Andrews,</hi> who ſome few years after demiſed the Fee-ſimple to <hi>Pepper,</hi> and he almoſt in the Verge of our Remembrance ſold it to Sir <hi>Thomas VVilford</hi> of <hi>Ilden,</hi> and he in our Memory alienated it to <hi>Richards</hi> of <hi>Dover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although the greateſt part of this Mannor was of ſecular Concernment, yet I find that the Prior of St. <hi>Martins</hi> in <hi>Dover</hi> had ſome Intereſt in it, as appears by an Inquiſition taken after the Death of <hi>John Atte-hall,</hi> where it is proved in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Numb.</hi> 129. <hi>Parte ſecunda,</hi> that he held Lands at his Death at <hi>Maxton</hi> of that Covent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Siberſton</hi> is the laſt place of Account in <hi>Hougham;</hi> it gave Name in elder Times to a Family ſo ſtyled; for in an old Deed without Date, in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham-Wood</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> lately deceaſed, I find <hi>Richard de Siberſton</hi> demiſes it to <hi>John Monins,</hi> and in another Deed I diſcover that <hi>John Monins</hi> Son of <hi>John Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nins,</hi> paſſes the third Part of his Mannor of <hi>Siberſton</hi> to <hi>John Monins</hi> the elder, in the thirty ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. And this I think is Authority ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to evidence to the Publique, that it was a parcel of that Eſtate that owned the Intereſt and Signory of that eminent Family, in which it lay couched until the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was by Sale tranſplanted into <hi>Pepper,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor in our Fathers Remembrance conveyed it to <hi>Moulton</hi> of <hi>Retherhed,</hi> vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Redriff</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> in whoſe Deſcendants the Inheritance of it does ſtill continue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hunton</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Twiford,</hi> celebrates the Memory of an ancient Family, called <hi>Lenham,</hi> who were once Proprietaries of it. <hi>Nicolas de Lenham</hi> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannour of <hi>Hunton,</hi> in the forty firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third; but about the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, the Intereſt of it was departed from this Family, for <hi>William de Lenham</hi> determined in <hi>Eleanor de Lenham,</hi> his ſole Inheritrix, and ſhe by matching with <hi>John Gifford,</hi> wrapt up this and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,</hi> another little Mannor in this Pariſh, which likewiſe was parcel of <hi>Lenhams</hi> Eſtate, in the Demeaſne of that Family; and he and his Wife paid Releif for <hi>Hunton</hi> and <hi>Benſted,</hi> in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight. But after this, it was not long permanent in this Family; for about the Beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, it was paſſed away with <hi>Benſted</hi> to <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Clinton,</hi> who in the twenty eighth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, was found Heir to his Cozen <hi>William Clinton,</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington;</hi> for that Land which he held <hi>Jure proprio &amp; nativo,</hi> not <hi>Jure uxoris Julianae de Leybourne</hi> in this County. And the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of this <hi>John,</hi> and of his Grand child ...... Lord <hi>Clinton</hi> (who paid Relief, in the fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, for his Mannor of <hi>Hunton,</hi> at the Marriage of <hi>Blanch</hi> that Prince's Daughter) have eſcaped the furious Barbarity of theſe Times, and ſtand yet undemoliſhed in the Church-Windows: and from this laſt did it deſcend to <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Clinton</hi> his Succeſſor, who about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh alienated the Fee-ſimple to Sir <hi>Henry Wiatt,</hi> one of the Privy Councel to the ſaid Monarch, and his Son Sir <hi>Thomas Wiatt</hi> the elder died ſeiſed of it, in the thirty fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and tranſmitted it with <hi>Benſted,</hi> which his Grand-father likewiſe bought of the Lord <hi>Clinton,</hi> to his infortunate Son Sir <hi>Thomas Wiatt,</hi> who adhering too ſtrictly to an unhappy Clauſe in the Teſtament of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, which obliges his Councel not to ſuffer his Daughters to eſpouſe any Forrainer, involved him in that dyſaſtrous Deſign, which could not be expiated, but by the Forfeiture of his Life and Eſtate, in which this Mannor of <hi>Hunton</hi> being concerned; it was in the ſecond year of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> granted to her Atturney General, Sir <hi>John Baker</hi> of <hi>Siſinghurſt,</hi> from whom the Title in the Stream of Succeſſion, lately glided down to his Heir General Sir <hi>John Baker</hi> Baronet, Son
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103337:106"/>and Heir to Sir <hi>John Baker</hi> Baronet, not many years ſince deceaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Burſton</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Hunton,</hi> which is eminent for being the Seat of <hi>John de Burſton,</hi> which the Dateleſs Deeds that relate to this Family, from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Conjecture of the Hand-writing, which is calculated for the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, record to have lived in that Prince's Time, and there was Land like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe about <hi>Wye</hi> and <hi>Crundall,</hi> that acknowledged the Juriſdiction of this Family; for in the forty fifth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Waretius de Valoigns</hi> Knight, makes a Releaſe of his Title to ſome Lands in thoſe Pariſhes to <hi>John de Burſton,</hi> and in this Family did this Seat remain for many Deſcents, and was productive of men of no deſpicable Account in this Track: amongſt whom <hi>William Burſton</hi> was returned, in the twenty ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, by <hi>Gervas Clifton</hi> then Sheriff, <hi>inter illos qui portabant Arma Antiqua.</hi> In the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, Alderman <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>London</hi> was reſident here, and added much both of Building and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to this Fabrick; but certainly it was only as Leſſee; for I cannot find that he was ever Proprietary of it, for about the Beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was ſold by <hi>Burſton</hi> to Sir <hi>Thomas Vane,</hi> who upon his Deceaſe gave it to his ſecond Son ...... <hi>Vane,</hi> from whom it deſcended to his Heir Sir <hi>George Vane,</hi> whoſe Widdow Dowager the Lady ...... <hi>Vane</hi> is now in Poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hunton</hi> had the Grant of a Market procured to it by <hi>Nicolas de Lenham,</hi> on the Tueſday, and a yearly Fair to continue five Dayes, the Vigil, the Day of the Aſſumption of our Lady, and three Dayes after, <hi>Pat.</hi> 41. <hi>Henrici tertii Memb.</hi> 7.</p>

                  <hi>Hucking</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Eyhorne,</hi> is involved in the Mannor of <hi>Hollingbourne,</hi> and was enſtated on the Prior and Convent of <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> when that by a muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Donation, augmented the Revenue of that Priory.</p>
               <p>Yet there is an ancient Seat in this Pariſh, called <hi>Rumpſted,</hi> which never was couched in the Spiritual Patrimony; for it had anciently Owners of that Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Sir <hi>William de Rumpſted</hi> held this, and a Caſtellated Manſion in <hi>Sevenoke,</hi> of that Denomination, in the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and he had Iſſue Sir <hi>John Rumpſted,</hi> poſſeſt of this place and <hi>Rumpſted</hi> in <hi>Sevenoke,</hi> and, as the Tradition aſſerts, educated Sir <hi>William Sevenoke,</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> in the year of Grace 1418. In Ages of a nearer Deſcent to us, that is, in the third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, I find <hi>Richard Peverell</hi> to have enjoyed it. And in Times ſubſequent to theſe, the <hi>Peckhams;</hi> but their Poſſeſſion was very frail, for in the Raign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> I find it to be in <hi>Figge,</hi> a Name of no deſpicable Character in this Pariſh; but it was very tranſitory here likewiſe; for about the Beginning of King <hi>James,</hi> the Title was interwoven with the Intereſt of <hi>Thompſon,</hi> who in our Fathers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, conveyed it by Sale to Mr. ...... <hi>Taylor,</hi> Fruiterer to the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Prince; and his Diſcendant, not many years ſince alienated it to Mr. <hi>Stringer</hi> of <hi>Goudherſt.</hi>

                  <hi>ICkham</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Downehamford,</hi> was given by King <hi>Offa</hi> to <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> and to the Monks of that Covent, in the year 781. under the Notion of fifteen Plough-lands, and was for a Supplement of Dyet. This Donation in the year 958. was confirmed by <hi>Athelward, Odo</hi> the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> being then preſent, and atteſting the Ratification: In the Time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, when the firſt Deſign of Doomeſday Book was ſtarted; it was rated at four Sullings or Plough-lands: nor did it fall in that Account, when that generall Regiſter was perfected, which was in the twentieth year of the Conqueror, defending it ſelf at the ſame Eſtimate, and upon the Appraiſment was valued at thirty pound. And here it was faſtned until King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth finding the Revenue of the Church was diffuſed into too wide a Latitude and Circumference, contracted it by a general
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:103337:107"/>Diſſolution into a narrower Orbe, and having rent off this Mannor from the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Demeaſne, like an Excreſcence ſprouting out from a luxuriant Stem, he ingrafted it again by his Letters Patent, on the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> and they ſettled it by Leaſe on <hi>Edward Iſaack</hi> a Noble Confeſſor for the Proteſtant Religion, in the Raign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when ſo many were ſent to Heaven, like ſo many <hi>Elias's Flammeis vecti Quadrigis</hi> in Chariots of fire, who rather choſe to deſert his Country, then abandon his Religion, and to loſe his Eſtate rather then to debauch or relinquiſh his Conſcience, as his Epitaph on an old Tablet affixed to a Pillar contiguous to his Grave-ſtone in the Nave of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> at <hi>Canterbury</hi> does inſtruct us. Upon his Receſſe, this was ſeized upon by the Crown, and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> by Grant united it to the Revenue of <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> whoſe infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Grand-child <hi>Henry Brooke,</hi> being attainted, in the Raign of King <hi>James,</hi> that Monarch reſtored his Eſtate, forfeited here, to <hi>Robert Cecill</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> his Brother in Law, whoſe Son <hi>Robert,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> holds the inſtant Poſſeſſion of it, but hath lately alienated ſome part of it to Mr. <hi>Roger Lukin</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>

                  <hi>Apulton</hi> is a ſecond Mannor in <hi>Ickham,</hi> written in old Deeds <hi>Apylton,</hi> as being the Inheritance of a Family of that Name; for in an old Deed of <hi>Reginald de Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> that was owner of <hi>Lukedale</hi> in <hi>Littlebourne,</hi> not far diſtant, one <hi>William de Apylton</hi> of <hi>Ickham</hi> is a Witneſs; but whether this Family was knit by any Relation to the Noble Family of the <hi>Apyltons</hi> of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> I am incertain. Afterwards, the <hi>Denis's</hi> were poſſeſt of it, and one <hi>John Denis</hi> of <hi>Apulton</hi> in <hi>Ickham,</hi> who was Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> in the year of Grace 1360. Founded here a Chauntry, in the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, as appears by an old Manuſcript, in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Thomas Denne,</hi> lately deceaſed, and was called <hi>Denis</hi> Chauntry, and the Lands which relate to it, are at this Day ſtyled <hi>Denis</hi> Lands: After this Family was worn out, I find one <hi>Adam Oldmeade,</hi> by the private Deeds, to be in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, owner of it; from whom before the latter end of that Prince, it came over by Sale to <hi>Bemboe,</hi> and from him to <hi>Hunt,</hi> in which Family it made no long ſtay. For about the latter of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, I find it alienated to <hi>Dormer,</hi> a Branch of the <hi>Dormers</hi> of <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> and from this Name not many years after it went away to <hi>Gaſon,</hi> a Name very ancient in this Pariſh, and here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was the Poſſeſſion of as brief a Date; for <hi>Dormer</hi> by Sale paſſed it away to <hi>Hodgekin</hi> (whoſe Anceſtors were formerly poſſeſt of <hi>Uffington</hi> in <hi>Gonſton,</hi> and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it by Sale to <hi>Aſhenden</hi>) and here likewiſe was the Title very variable, for within the Circle of fourſcore years it acknowledged not only this Family; but <hi>Rutland, Winter,</hi> and <hi>Dee,</hi> to have been its Succeſſive Proprietaries: from the laſt of which, not many years ſince, it was by Sale carried off to <hi>Froſtall,</hi> in which name it is ſtill reſident.</p>
               <p>The Mannor of <hi>Baa</hi> in this Pariſh, had anciently Poſſeſſors of that Sirname, as appears by an old Fragment of Glaſs in the Church Windows, whereon is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed this incoherent Inſcription. <hi>Hic ......

Richard de Capell</hi> this Man's Succeſſor, dyed poſſeſt of <hi>Capell Court</hi> in <hi>Werehorn,</hi> and this here, in the fifteenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond. But after this Man's deceaſe, it did not long remain annexed to the Name: for this Family expiring in a Female Heir, ſhee by matching with <hi>Harlackenden,</hi> of the Borough of <hi>Harlackenden</hi> in <hi>Woodchurch,</hi> united it to the Patrimony of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and here it reſted untill the Beginning of King <hi>James,</hi> and then <hi>Deborah,</hi> Sole Daughter and Heir of <hi>Walter Harlackenden,</hi> a Branch of the aboveſaid Stem by eſpouſing Sir <hi>Edward Hales,</hi> late of <hi>Tunſtall</hi> deceaſed, entwined it with his Demeaſne: upon whoſe Death, it devolved to his Grandchild Sir <hi>Edward Hales,</hi> now of <hi>Tunſtall</hi> Baronet.</p>

                  <hi>Cheyneys Court</hi> is a ſecond place of Account in this Pariſh, and had this Name impoſed upon it, becauſe it lay folded up in the Revenue of that Name, of that Family, <hi>Alexander de Cheyney,</hi> who flouriſhed in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, in the ninth of which Prince's raign he was one of that Catalogue, as appears by <hi>Kirkbie</hi>'s Inqueſt kept in the Exchequer, who was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in that ſucceſſefull War, which was commenced by that Monarch againſt the <hi>Welſh,</hi> and dyed poſſeſt of this Mannor, in the twenty fourth year of his Government. After whoſe Deceaſe, it was conſtantly reſident in this Family, untill <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cheyney.</hi> Son of Sir <hi>Thomas Cheyney,</hi> about the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> paſſed it away by Sale to Mr. <hi>Richard Knatchbull,</hi> whoſe Heir Generall, Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbull,</hi> Knight and Baronet, extracted originally, from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Knatchbulls</hi> of <hi>Limne,</hi> where I find the Name by Deeds, very ancient, is now in the Poſſeſſion of the Demeaſne, but the Mannor was conveyed by Sale to Sir <hi>Walter Roberts.</hi>

                  <hi>More Court</hi> is a third place in <hi>Ivie Church,</hi> which muſt not find its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrement in Silence becauſe it was the ancient Seat of the <hi>Moores,</hi> now Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of <hi>Mellifont</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before they were tranſplanted into <hi>More-place</hi> in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenden,</hi> by matching with the Heir generall of Sir <hi>William Brenchley,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench, under <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and this is evident by a Fine levyed, between <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Thomas de Iden,</hi> and <hi>John de More</hi> of <hi>Ivie-church</hi> (ſo he is named in the Record) by which, the ſaid <hi>John</hi> paſſes away Land to <hi>John de More</hi> of <hi>Rolvenden,</hi> in the year of <hi>Grace</hi> 1280. And in this Family for many Generations was it conſtant and permanent, untill the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh; and then the common Viciſſitude of Purchaſe (which like a Moath or Canker, frets into ancient Titles) brought it to be the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Taylor,</hi> and here it was ſettled untill in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, (as by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplification, now in the Hands of <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi> Esq; is evident) it was divided between <hi>William</hi> and <hi>John Taylor</hi> Gentlemen; and they immediately after, by a joint and mutuall Concurrence, alienated their Intereſt here, to <hi>Peter Godfrey</hi> Gentleman, Great Grand-father to Sir <hi>Thomas Godfrey,</hi> now of <hi>Hepington</hi> in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hardres,</hi> who is the inſtant Proprietary of it.</p>

                  <hi>Iwade</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Milton,</hi> is a ſmall Pariſh, ſituated no great diſtance from the <hi>Swale,</hi> which expoſes it ſelf to the injurious Impreſſion of many Fogs, and other ſullen Vapours, which exhale, from the adjacent Mariſhes; ſo that, the Air becomming by theſe Miſts, contagious and unheathfull, we muſt expect, that it cannot be very populous, nor contain many places in it, conſiderable in their Account. The only place of Note being <hi>Colſhill-hall,</hi> a place in its Name, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to its Poſition, though formerly it had Owners of its own Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for in a Deed of <hi>William de Codſhill,</hi> who held Land at <hi>Middleton Bobbing,</hi> and elſewhere, and which bears Date, from about the fiftieth of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, I find one <hi>John de Colſted</hi> a Witneſſe. But in Times of no great diſtance, from that Prince's Raign, I find the <hi>Alefs</hi> or <hi>Alephs,</hi> poſſeſt of it, and to this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103337:108"/>does the ancient Shell or Fabrick of the Houſe, owe the principal part of its Structure; eſpecially that, which by its Antiquity obliges the Eye to ſo much Regard and Veneration as is evident by the Hall, which in diverſe places is diaper'd with an A. and then a Leafe, a Rebus, which treaſures up the Relique of the Name, remaining unwritten. And appears to be exceeding ancient, by the Character calculated for the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. From whoſe Time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Beginning of the Raign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it continued knit to this Name of <hi>Alef;</hi> and then <hi>Thomas Aleph,</hi> the laſt of this Name, being extinguiſhed in a Daughter and Heir called <hi>Margaret,</hi> matched to <hi>John Monins</hi> Eſquire, this by that Alliance, became the Inheritance of that Name, but made no long aboad in their Revenue: for in our Grand-fathers memory, it went away by Sale from <hi>Monins</hi> to <hi>Lewin;</hi> and <hi>Lewin,</hi> not many years ſince, concluding in a Female In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritrix, ſhe by being affianced to <hi>Rogers,</hi> branched out from <hi>Rogers</hi> of <hi>Brianſon</hi> in the Weſt, linked it to the Inheritance of that Family, where it had as brief a Reſidence; for <hi>Rogers</hi> not long ſince, dying without Iſſue-male, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his only Heir, by her eſpouſalls with <hi>Charles Cavendiſh,</hi> Lord <hi>Mansfield,</hi> hath now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven it with the Propriety and Income, relating to that eminent and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Family.</p>

                  <hi>KEmſing</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Codſheath,</hi> is a Pariſh, which, in Reſpect of its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit and Dimenſion, is but deſpicable; but, in Relation to thoſe Perſons who in elder Times were Poſſeſſors of it, it is not inferiour in its value to ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pariſh in this Hundred. The firſt that I find to be its Proprietary, was <hi>Falca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius de Brent,</hi> and he is mentioned in the Red-book kept in the Exchequer, to have held it in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and was Caſtellan likewiſe of <hi>Kemſing-Caſtle,</hi> a place then of important Concernment, though now it's Skel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton it ſelf, be ſhrunk into ſuch a deſolate and neglected Maſſe of Rubbiſh, that it would be now as difficult to trace it out or find it, as it was formerly to conquer it. And this Mans Son, was that <hi>Falcatius de Brent,</hi> ſo famous in our Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles for thoſe wild Diſorders and Sallies ariſing from thoſe Boilings and Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations which were caſt out by the Calentures of Youth, rather then from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vitious Habit, contracted from ſeverall Acts of Exceſſe, and riveted into his Soul. Yet, it ſeems, theſe Excurſions of his, did ſo diſguſt King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, that he made the Forfeiture of his Eſtate here, pay the price of his Vanities. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that name, his Misfortunes rather then his Treaſons, ſeem to Challenge. And then that Prince, in the ſixth year of his Reign, granted it, with the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Sauters</hi> in <hi>Sutton at Hone,</hi> to <hi>Baldwin de Betun</hi> Earl of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> in Right of his Wife <hi>Hawis,</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>William le Groſſe</hi> Earl of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Holderneſſe.</hi> And this <hi>Baldwin,</hi> had, by her, two Daughters and Coheirs, <hi>Hawis</hi> the eldeſt of them, was married to <hi>William le Marſhall</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> to whom her Father gave with her in Marriage, <hi>Kemſing Sawters,</hi> and much other Land in this County: but this Mans Succeſſor, <hi>Anſelme le Marſhall</hi> Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,</hi> dying without Iſſue, <hi>Robert Bigod</hi> Earl of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> by <hi>Mawd</hi> his Mother, the Heir Generall of the Family, as being Siſter to <hi>Gilbert Marſhall</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> entered upon the Eſtate of that Family, here at <hi>Kemſing:</hi> and he paſſed it away to <hi>Otho</hi> Lord <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> with the Advowſon of the Church of <hi>Kemſing,</hi> in the eleventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt. And after this Family was worn out, I find the <hi>Says</hi> to Step into the Inheritance, and <hi>Geffrey de Say,</hi> held it at his Death, which was in the forty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 24. <hi>Parte ſecunda.</hi> From whom, the Propriety flowed down to his Succeſſor <hi>Geffrey</hi> Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and he concluded in two Daughters and Coheirs, whereof <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:103337:108"/>one of them was affianced to Sir <hi>William Fiennes:</hi> who in her Right was inveſted in <hi>Kemſing,</hi> and from him was the Title by Deſcent tranſported over to <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Fiennes,</hi> Son of <hi>James</hi> Lord <hi>Fiennes,</hi> and he in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Geffrey Bolein,</hi> Great Grand-father to <hi>George</hi> Viſcount <hi>Rochford,</hi> who was beheaded and left no Iſſue, in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, ſo that this upon his Father Sir <hi>Thomas Boleyn,</hi> Earl of <hi>Wilts,</hi> departure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Iſſue-male, in the thirtieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, devolved to that Prince, who ſeiſed upon it in Right of his Wife, the infortunate <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> who was eldeſt Siſter to the unhappy Viſcount. And here in the Revenue of the Crown did it lie couched, until Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the firſt year of her Raign, paſſed it away by Grant to her Kinſman <hi>Henry Cary</hi> Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> Son of <hi>William Cary,</hi> Eſquire of the Body to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and of <hi>Mary</hi> his Wife, Siſter to Q. <hi>Anne,</hi> Mother to the above ſaid Princeſſe, and his Grandchild <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Dover,</hi> alienated his Right in it to <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and he not many years ſince, paſſed it away to Mr. ...... <hi>Smith,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Dog-Smith,</hi> who upon his Deceaſe ſettled the Fee-ſimple for ever on the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke.</hi>

               <p>There was an old Knightly Family, which tooke their Sirname from this Pariſh, and was ſtyled <hi>Kemſing,</hi> and their Coat was <hi>Argent,</hi> a <hi>Feſſe</hi> and <hi>Cheveron,</hi> interla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Sables,</hi> now quatered by Mr. <hi>William Hart</hi> of <hi>Lullingſton</hi> Eſquire, in Right of <hi>Peche,</hi> who married the Heir General.</p>

                  <hi>Kenardington</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Blackborn,</hi> is by Contraction called <hi>Kenarton:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it cannot much boaſt of the healthful ſituation thereof, yet it hath had Lords and Owners of a very great Eſtimate; <hi>Will. de Normannia</hi> held it in the Raign of K. <hi>John,</hi> and part of the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, as appears by the Pipe Rolls, which relate to thoſe Times, and concern this County:
<note place="margin">Rafe de Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill <hi>is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in the liſt of thoſe Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who were with</hi> Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard <hi>the firſt at the Seige of</hi> Acon <hi>in</hi> Paleſtine.</note> After him his Son <hi>Thomas de Normannia</hi> or <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manvill;</hi> for ſo he is written in the ancient Rolls ſucceeded in the Poſſeſſion of it, but died in the eleventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, without Iſſue-male; ſo that by his only Daughter and Heir it devolved to be the Poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>William de Baſing,</hi> with the Mannor of <hi>Cockride</hi> likewiſe, which was folded up in her Inheritance, and was one of thoſe Knights who accompanied King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, in the twenty eighth year of his Raign, in that ſuccesful Expedition which he was ingaged in, when he undertook the Conqueſt of <hi>Scotland.</hi> After him, <hi>William de Baſing</hi> held it, and was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the eighth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond; and dying in his Shrievalty, <hi>Margaret</hi> his Widdow accounted for the Profits of the County, as the Records of the Pipe Office ſet forth. Sir <hi>Thomas de Baſing</hi> his Son died ſeiſed of it, in the twenty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and paid reſpective Aid for it under the Notion of a whole Knights Fee, at making the Black Prince Knight, and left it to <hi>John</hi> his Son, a Child of eight years of Age, who after was Knighted, and died poſſeſt of it in the ſeventh year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and left it to <hi>Thomas</hi> his Son and Heir, then eleven years of Age, and he had Iſſue <hi>Thomas</hi> likewiſe, who dying without Iſſue, <hi>John Baſing</hi> his Uncle was found to be his Heir, but was ſcarce planted in his new acquired Patrimony: but he alſo, in the twenty fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, expired without Iſſue, ſo that the Inheritance devolved to <hi>Alice</hi> his Siſter matched to <hi>Thomas Mackworth,</hi> as the Heir General of the Family. And thus were the <hi>Baſings</hi> at this Place extinguiſhed, who before they planted in <hi>Kent,</hi> were regiſtred amongſt the prime Gentlemen of <hi>Middleſex: Salomon de Baſing</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> the laſt year of King <hi>John; Adam de Baſing</hi> was Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> in the thirty ſixth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third; and <hi>Robert de Baſing</hi> ſucceeded in that Office, in the ſeventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Baſings-Hall</hi> ows both his Name and Foundation to this Family; and <hi>John Stow</hi> in his Survey of <hi>London,</hi> aſcribes to them the Degree of Barons of the Realm. But to return into that Path from whence this Diſcourſe had diverted me. After <hi>Mackworth,</hi> which, by Female Devolution, was poſſeſt of this Mannor, was worn out, which was about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh: The <hi>Hornes</hi> of <hi>Hornes-place</hi> in this Pariſh, were by Purchaſe ſettled in the Inheritance. Gentlemen certainly they were of as eminent Account as any in this Territory, and had been Proprietaries of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:103337:109"/>this Seat for many Hundreds of years; for one <hi>Ralph de Hurne</hi> of <hi>Kenardington,</hi> was one of the <hi>Recognitores magnae Aſſiſae,</hi> in the Raign of King <hi>John,</hi> Perſons, who, before the Office of Juſtice of Peace was inſtituted, did ſupply their Place, and were much in Reſemblance, like the Grand Inqueſt at this Day, being aſſiſtant both by their preſence and concurrent Counſels to the Juſtices in <hi>Eyre,</hi> in all the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions which did relate to Cauſes Criminal, emergent <hi>à tribus Forisfacturis,</hi> or the three Forfeitures, Murder, Felony, and Breach of the Peace. But to proceed: In this Family, did the Propriety both of <hi>Hernes-place</hi> and <hi>Kenardington</hi> thus pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed of <hi>Mackworth,</hi> lie rolled up together, until the twelfth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then <hi>Bennet Horne</hi> the Heir General of both theſe being matched to ...... <hi>Guldford</hi> a <hi>Romiſh Catholick,</hi> he, to decline the Oath of Supremacy, fled beyond Sea with his Wife, upon whoſe Receſſe the Crown ſeiſed upon that Eſtate, which had formerly accrewed to him in behalf of his Wife at this place, as eſchea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Statute of <hi>praemunire.</hi> And the above ſaid Princeſſe immediately after, granted the Premiſes thus forfeited to <hi>Walter Moile</hi> of <hi>Buckwell</hi> Eſquire, Anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to Mr. <hi>Robert Moile,</hi> who claims the preſent Signiory both of <hi>Kenardington</hi> and <hi>Hornes-place.</hi>

                  <hi>Kenington,</hi> in the Hundreds of <hi>Chart</hi> and <hi>Longbridge,</hi> was a Mannor which alwaies related to the Crown, as is intimated by the Name, where lie tacitly couched ſome Hints of thoſe who were Proprietaries of it. And <hi>Keningbrooke,</hi> which is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed within the Limits of this Pariſh, was annexed by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror to his Royal Mannor of <hi>Wye,</hi> and was looked upon as an Appendage to it, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Fate of it at the common Diſſolution, when the other was plucked away from the Patrimony of <hi>Battell Abby,</hi> in which ever ſince the Original Donation of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror it had been reſident, and was with the Mannor of <hi>Wye,</hi> by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> granted, in the firſt year of her Raign, to her Kinſman <hi>Henry Cary</hi> Lord <hi>Hunſdon:</hi> and his Grand-child <hi>Hen.</hi> Earl of <hi>Dover,</hi> not many years ſince, paſſed it away by Sale to Sir <hi>Tho.

                  <hi>Bibrooke</hi> is a ſecond Place in <hi>Kenington,</hi> which claims ſome Conſideration. It was, as appears by very old Evidences, the Patrimony of a Family called <hi>Godwin,</hi> which flouriſhed here in the Raign of King <hi>John, Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt; but after this it began to wither, and before the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, was altogether crumbled away, the laſt of whom that I find by publique Record to be inveſted in the Poſſeſſion, was <hi>William Godwin,</hi> who enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the thirty ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 93. The next Family after this, which was entituled to the Poſſeſſion, was <hi>Belknap;</hi> but Sir <hi>Robert Belknap</hi> being infortunately attainted and baniſhed, in the tenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, to whoſe Cauſe and Quarrel he had wholly vowed his Life and Service, and his Eſtate, as to the principall part, confiſcated, in which this lay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, the ſame Monarch, in the thirteenth year of his Raign, granted it to <hi>William Ellys,</hi> who was at that Time one of the Conſervators or Juſtices of the Peace of this County, whoſe Capital Seat was at <hi>Burton</hi> in this Pariſh, though in very old Deeds it is written <hi>Burſton,</hi> as being indeed the Seat of a Branch of that Family, from whom it came over about the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, to <hi>Ellys,</hi> but in the Name of <hi>Ellys</hi> the Title of <hi>Bibrooke</hi> was not long-liv'd; for about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, I find it by Purchaſe inveſted in <hi>Shelley,</hi> by whoſe Heir General it devolved in the Time of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, to <hi>May,</hi> from whom not long after it was alienated to <hi>Tilden,</hi> where it continued, until about the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and then the ſame Revolution tranſported the Title to <hi>Beſt,</hi> who about the latter end of that Princeſſe, paſſed it away by Sale to <hi>Hall,</hi> Anceſtor to Mr. <hi>Nevill Hall,</hi> the preſent Lord of this Manſion; but <hi>Burton</hi> was more conſtant to the Family of <hi>Ellys,</hi> and remained linked to the Patrimony of that Name, until that Age, which bordered upon our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was demiſed by Sale to <hi>Hall,</hi> in whoſe Deſcendant Mr. <hi>Nevill Hall,</hi> the Propriety is at preſent reſident.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Keſton</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Rokeſley,</hi> belonged (in the twentieth year of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, as the Pages of <hi>Doomſ-day</hi> Book inform me) to <hi>Gilbert de Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninot,</hi> and there it is written <hi>Cheſton:</hi> and continued in his Name, untill the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of King <hi>John;</hi> and then by the Heir Generall of this Family, it came to be poſſeſt of <hi>Say,</hi> of <hi>Says-court</hi> in <hi>Deptford:</hi> but ſtayed not long in this Name, for in the twenty fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Alexander de Cheyney</hi> dyed poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of it, as appears <hi>Rot.

But in his Poſterity likewiſe, it had no long Reſidence; for about the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to <hi>Stephen de Aſhway;</hi> and he in the thirty eighth of this Prince, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <hi>Keſton.</hi> And here the Title fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, untill the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and then it was alienated with <hi>Baſton,</hi> which had ſtill the ſame original and ſucceſſive Proprietaries with <hi>Keſton,</hi> to <hi>Squerris</hi> of <hi>Squerries-court</hi> in <hi>Weſterham:</hi> and here it made its aboad untill the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then it devolved by <hi>Dorothy</hi> Daughter and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heir of <hi>Thomas Squerrie,</hi> to <hi>Richard Mervin</hi> of <hi>Fountell</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> who paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>Keſton</hi> and <hi>Baſton,</hi> both which accrued to him, upon the Diviſion of <hi>Squerrie's</hi> Eſtate, to <hi>Philp Reynolds,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Tregarthen,</hi> as his Truſtees; and they, in the eighth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, convey them both to <hi>Richard Scroope</hi> and <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Scroop;</hi> from whom about the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, they came to <hi>Henry Heyden</hi> Eſquire; and he in the firſt year of <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, as is manifeſt, by an old Court-rol, held a Court here at <hi>Keſton;</hi> and from him, did the Propriety, by the Steps of ſeveral Deſcents, come down to that worthy Perſon Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon;</hi> who about the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> demiſed all his Intereſt in <hi>Keſton</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> to Sir <hi>Samuel Lennard,</hi> whoſe Son Sir <hi>Stephen Lennard,</hi> is ſtill entituled to the Fee-ſimple of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> conjectures in his <hi>Britannia,</hi> ſomething of the Name of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to be couched in the Etymologie of this place, becauſe at <hi>Baſton,</hi> adjoyning, there is an ancient Camp, ſtupendious for the heighth of double Rampiers, and depth of double Ditches, hardly paralleled elſewhere, and queſtionleſſe the work of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Labouring Hands. Of what Capacity it was, is not now exactly to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, much of it being overgrown with a Thicket: but very vaſt it was, as may be collected, from its remains, which are yet apparent.

                  <hi>Denhill</hi> in this Pariſh was not only the Seat, but likewiſe the Seminary of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of eminent Note in this County; <hi>Ralph de Den</hi> held much Land in <hi>Romney Merſh,</hi> and likewiſe at <hi>Buckhurſt</hi> in <hi>Suſſex</hi> (as appears by an old Roll now in the Hands of the Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi>) about the twentieth of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, and is ſtyled in the Record, Son of <hi>Robert Pincerna,</hi> a Name impoſed upon his Father from being, as is probable, either Butler or Sewer to <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, an Office of no vulgar Account in thoſe Times. Sir <hi>Alured de Den</hi> flouriſhed in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and was a Perſon of ſignal Eſtimate in that Age; for when the Laws of <hi>Romney Merſh</hi> were compiled by that venerable Judge, <hi>Henry de Bath,</hi> from which all <hi>England</hi> receives Directions for Sewers, this Sir <hi>Alured</hi> and <hi>Nicolas de Haudloe</hi> were his Aſſociates and Aſſiſtants in the Compoſure of them, in the forty ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, on Saturday next after the Nativity of St. <hi>Mary;</hi> and which makes this Sir <hi>Alured de Den</hi> more remarkable, he ſealed even in that Age, divided by ſo remote a Diſtance from us, with three <hi>Leopards Heads</hi> couped and full faced, which is the ancient paternal Coat of this Family. Indeed if I ſhould enter into a particular Diſcourſe of all thoſe Perſons who have been originally extracted from this Family, and were formerly eminent, not only within the private Sphere of this County, as being inveſted with the Commiſſion of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Peace, and other Offices of publique Truſt and Concernment, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhone like Stars of the firſt Magnitude, within the two Orbes of Divinity, and the Law both Civil and Municipal; the Survey of this Place, which I intend to retrench within as narrow Bounds as may be, muſt ſwell into a particular Treatiſe; it is enough therefore to inform the Reader, that it hath been ſo many Centuries of years folded up in the Propriety of <hi>Den.</hi> that there is no <hi>Gappe</hi> at all in the Succeſſion between <hi>Ralph de Den</hi> the firſt of that Name, and <hi>Tho.

In the thirty firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>John de Bankwell</hi> had a Grant by the King's Charter, to have Free-Warren to all his Lands in <hi>Lee, Leveſham</hi> and <hi>Bromley.</hi> And in the return of <hi>John de Shelving</hi> High Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the ſixteenth and part of the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, of all the Knights and men at Arms in this Connty, <hi>William de Bankwell</hi> is mentioned in the ſecond degree; he dyed the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and left <hi>Thomas Bankwell</hi> his Heir; who in the thirty fifty year of that Prince's Government, deceaſed poſſeſt of <hi>Lee,</hi> and a very large proportion of other Land in <hi>Modingham, Sherfholt</hi> (now, I think, corruptly called <hi>Shrawfield</hi>) <hi>Littlecroft Bankers,</hi> both in <hi>Lee, Bromley, Leveſham Eltham, Chiſelhurſt, Detling, Langſhot,</hi> and <hi>Wickham</hi> by <hi>Bromley;</hi> and left three Sons, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Cuſtome of <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> Heirs to his Inheritance, which were <hi>John, William</hi> and <hi>Robert Bankwell:</hi> but upon the diſtinguiſhing the Eſtate into parcels, <hi>Lee, Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and <hi>Sherfholt,</hi> now corruptly called <hi>Shrawfield,</hi> fell to be the patrimony of <hi>John Bankwell,</hi> and in this Mans Lineage did the Inheritance of theſe places divers years reſide; till the Name was circumſcribed in a Female Heir, who being wedded to <hi>John Arrapon,</hi> brought this place to be an adjunct to his Inheritance: And here, I confeſs, for want of information either from publick or private Record, I am at a loſſe, and cannot diſcover, whether by <hi>Arrapon</hi> it was ſold to the Crown, and from the Crown tranſmitted to <hi>Woodvill,</hi> or elſe immediately paſſed away by ſale to <hi>Richard Woodvill,</hi> Earl <hi>River,</hi> who enjoyed it: but upon his Son's untimely death on a Scaffold at <hi>Pomfret,</hi> being by the malice and ſubtlety of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, blaſted with an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion of Treaſon, that fatal Stroke which ſeparated his Head from his Body, divided his Eſtate here from this Name and Family, and united it by Eſcheat to the Crown: In whoſe Revenue it was reſident, until King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, (as is manifeſt by the original Patent) granted it to Sir <hi>Thomas Wroteley.</hi> In times of a more modern Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that is, about the Beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> I find it in the Tenure of <hi>Thomas Sackvill</hi> Lord <hi>Buckhurſt;</hi> but how it devolved to him, I confeſſe, I know not; and from him it deſcended to his Grandchild <hi>Richard Sackvill</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> who exchanged it with King <hi>James;</hi> whoſe Succeſſor King <hi>Charls,</hi> ſold the Royaltie and Fee-ſimple of it to <hi>Ralph Freeman</hi> Lord Maior of <hi>London,</hi> who gave it in Marriage with his Daughter and Heir to Sir <hi>George Sonds</hi> of <hi>Leeze-Court</hi> in <hi>Shelvich,</hi> Knight of the Bath, who by a Right derived from that Match, is the preſent Lord of <hi>Lee,</hi> and its two Appendages <hi>Bankers</hi> and <hi>Shrawfield.</hi>

The Hiſtory is well made up by many Authors; the Abſtract is thus. Queen <hi>Iſabel,</hi> Wife to <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, who had ever been the Nurſe of peace, and laboured to accord the King and his Barons, making her progreſſe towards <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was diſpoſed to lodge in this Caſtle, as belonging to the Lord <hi>Badeleſmer,</hi> who had been long King <hi>Edward's</hi> Steward; and ſending her Marſhal to make ready for her and her Train, they who kept the Caſtle, told him plainly that neither the Queen nor any elſe, ſhould enter without Letters from their Lord. The Queen her ſelf goes to the Caſtle, and receives the ſame Anſwer: whereupon ſhe is neceſſitated to take ſuch Lodging otherwhere as could be provided: Of which Indignity ſhe complains to the King, who reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with ſo much paſſion, as inſtantly with an Army collected in <hi>London,</hi> he layes Siege to the Caſtle, carries it, hangs the Caſtellan <hi>Thomas Colepeper,</hi> ſends the Lady and Children of the Lord <hi>Badeleſmer</hi> to the Tower, and ſeiſes upon his Goods and Treaſure. He, to revenge this Devaſtation of his Caſtle, aſſociates with the Barons, then in Arms, who pretended the Common good and publick Liberty of the People (they being ſtill that unhappy Veſſel which every Tempeſt ſhipwracks, but no Calm ſecures: Or, indeed, being like the Sea, which never ſwells into Diſorder, untill it be breath'd upon by intemperate Winds; and yet even thoſe very Winds break to pieces thoſe waters which they firſt raiſed into Billows and Surges.) But, to go on; This Deſign (whether the Foundation, on which it was fixt, were crazy and infirme or not, I know not) was Ruinous to <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Lord <hi>Badeleſmer,</hi> and the Barons his Partiſans; for they were defeared by the Forces of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and amongſt the reſt this Lord, and the Lord <hi>Aſhburnham</hi> being by their misfortune made priſoners, were put to Death at <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this Shipwrack, this Caſtle reverts to the Crown; and Arch-biſhop <hi>Arundell</hi> having a mind equivalent to his Birth, gets ſuch a Grant of this Caſtle, as in many Acts of his, he dates them, At his Caſtle of <hi>Leeds:</hi> and you may obſerve that this would not ſerve the turn neither, for he was at the ſame time Conſtable of the late before builded Caſtle of <hi>Quinborough.</hi> But the Eſtate he had in it determined with him, and then it remained in the Crown, and was reputed one of the Kings Houſes, and the Cuſtody was conferred upon ſome of the principal Gentlemen of <hi>Kent,</hi> whom the King <hi>pro tempore</hi> favoured. And it ſeems it had the Reputation to be a piece of important Strength in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth: for <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, as <hi>Fabian</hi> in his Chronicle relates <hi>fol.</hi> 165. was by that Prince ſent priſoner to this Caſtle. In the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, I find the propriety of it altered; for that Prince ſeeking to endear the <hi>St. Legers</hi> to him, who were then a Family who had a powerfull Influence upon this County, made <hi>Ralph St. Leger</hi> Eſquire, Conſtable of the Caſtle of <hi>Leeds,</hi> and annexed the park too, to his Grant,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:103337:115"/>(for anciently there belonged two Parks unto it, though both are now clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parked and vaniſhed) but the Fee-ſimple remained in the Crown, untill <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth in the fourth year of his Rule, granted it to <hi>Anthony St. Leger</hi> his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, who was Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and improved the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt in that Province by his Prudence and Magnanimity to that heighth and Advantage that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced moſt of the old Septs of the <hi>Irih</hi> Nobility, and made them become Feodall to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scepter, which could never be accompliſhed ſince the firſt Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> till his Time; but his Son Sir <hi>Warham St. Leger</hi> was the laſt of the Name, who was proprietary of <hi>Leeds</hi>-Caſtle, for he ſold it to Sir <hi>Richard Smith,</hi> who not long after determined in two Daughters and Co-heirs, matched to Sir <hi>Timothy Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> and to Mr. <hi>Barrow</hi> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who both by mutual Conſent did deveſt themſelves of their Intereſt in it, and by Sale tranſplanted the Inheritance into Sir <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> now of the Pariſh of <hi>Hollingbourne,</hi> who ſetled it in marriage upon his Son Sir <hi>Cheyney Colepeper</hi> now Lord of the Fee.</p>
               <p>The Priory of <hi>Leeds</hi> was founded by <hi>Robert de Crevequer,</hi> ſoon after the building of the Cattle, and not long after the Conqueſt, and ſtored with black Canons, or Canons of St. <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> and dedicated to St. <hi>Mary</hi> and St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi> The Succeſſors of this <hi>Robert de Crevequer</hi> were all of them Benefactors. <hi>Robert de Crevequer</hi> Son of <hi>Dan. de Crevequer,</hi> who was Son of <hi>Rob. de Crevequer</hi> the Founder, <hi>dedit Terras Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis de Leed pro Salute Animae Reg.

                  <hi>Linton</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Twyford,</hi> was anciently under the Juriſdiction and Signiory of Proprietaries called <hi>Capell,</hi> who had a Seat adopted into their Sirname, and called <hi>Capells-court;</hi> a Family certainly of great Antiquity, and no leſſe Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in this Track. <hi>John at Capell</hi> held Lands at <hi>Boxley</hi> called <hi>Tattelmell,</hi> in the thirty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, as appears by that King's Charter of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, of the Foundation of <hi>Boxley</hi> Abbey, <hi>Cart.</hi> 37. <hi>Memb.</hi> 9. <hi>Thomas at Capell,</hi> and <hi>James at Capell,</hi> were to find two Hobelers or leight Horſmen at <hi>Denge</hi> Merſh in the eleventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third.

               <p>Firſt <hi>Buckland,</hi> which is ſituated on the oppoſite Banck of the River, upon the Knob or Knoll of an Hill of eaſie Aſcent; from whence it takes in, a various and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Proſpect of the adjacent Valley; It was anciently part of the Demeaſn of the <hi>Bucklands;</hi> but whether it originally gave Seat and Sirname to them or not, is not evident; becauſe there was another Place, which likewiſe bore this Name at <hi>Luddeſdowne,</hi> and which alſo acknowledged it ſelf to be Parcel of their Proprietie; <hi>John de Buckland</hi> held it at his Death, which was in the third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and his Son and Heir was Sir <hi>John Buckland,</hi> who was a Perſon of remarkable Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Note in this Track; for he had Lands about <hi>Wouldham, Halling, Snodland, Ludſdowne</hi> and <hi>Shoreham,</hi> as well as at this Place.

                  <hi>Bigons, alias Digons,</hi> was the ancient Seat of the worthy Family of the <hi>Mapelyſdens,</hi> and I have a Deed in my Cuſtody, wherein one <hi>Edward Mapelyſden</hi> is mentioned, with this Addition, <hi>Edwardus Mapelyſden de Digons.</hi> The Deed bears Date from the twenty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and after the poſſeſſion had been for many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Succeſſively reſident in this Family, one of this Name, being unfortunately concerned in the Defection of Sir <hi>Thoma; Wyat,</hi> was blaſted with the guilt of High Treaſon, and ſo by Conſequence his Eſtate by Confiſcation, eſcheated to the Crown, from which it was granted to <hi>Nicholas Barham,</hi> after Serjeant at Law, who did much improve this Fabrick, with a Supplement of Building, from whoſe Heir it paſſed away by Sale to <hi>Hawle,</hi> and from him again ſoon after to Sir <hi>Francis Berneham,</hi> to whom this Manſion owes much of its Magnificence and Splendor, whoſe Son and Heir Mr. <hi>Edward Barneham</hi> Eſquire, has lately alienated his Intereſt in it, to Mr. <hi>Beale</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jordans-Court</hi> is a fifth place, which may exact our Notice, becauſe it gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of that Denomination; the next Family, after this was expired, which held it, was <hi>Roper,</hi> of the <hi>Ropers</hi> of <hi>St. Dunſtans</hi> in <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and <hi>John Roper</hi> ſold it to <hi>Edw.</hi> and <hi>Wil. Brouch,</hi> of <hi>Berſted</hi> about the thirty ſixth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and they quickly after alienated their Concernment to <hi>Atwood,</hi> from whom the ſame Fate, carried it away to <hi>Peirce,</hi> who by Sale tranſmitted his Right to <hi>Cook,</hi> and he ſuddenly after demiſed it to <hi>Crooke,</hi> where after the Title had made ſome ſhort abode, the Poſſeſſion was paſſed over to <hi>Potkins,</hi> extracted from the <hi>Fotkins</hi> of <hi>Sevenoke,</hi> where the Name was very ancient, from <hi>Potkin;</hi> by his Daughter and Coheir, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to <hi>Virgo,</hi> who about the latter end of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by Sale tranſlated the Poſſeſſion into <hi>Waſhington</hi> Juſtice of Peace, and often in the Commiſſion of Sewers, who ſold it to <hi>Godwin,</hi> from whom by Purchaſe, it came to be the Inheritance of <hi>Criſp,</hi> who in our Memory conveyed it away to <hi>Smith;</hi> and he, ſome few years ſince, by Sale, inveſted the Propriety in Mr. <hi>Beckman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Sheals</hi> is not to be forgotten, becauſe it was the Inheritance of <hi>Fremingham,</hi> for <hi>Ralph de Fremingham</hi> died ſeiſed of it, in the thirtieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and when this Family went out, the <hi>Pimps</hi> of <hi>Pimps-Court</hi> and <hi>Nettleſted,</hi> by Purchaſe became Lords of the Fee; from whom the ſame Fare brought it to acknowledge the Signory of the <hi>Iſleys</hi> of <hi>Sundrich;</hi> and here it continued, till Sir <hi>Henry Iſley</hi> in the Raign of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> being attainted of High Treaſon, it became Confiſcated to the Crown, and She in the ſecond year of her Government, granted it to Sir <hi>Walter Henley</hi> Knight, of <hi>Courſehorne</hi> in <hi>Cranbroke,</hi> in whoſe Name and poſierity the Poſſeſſion has remained Succeſſively planted till this Day.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Chillington</hi> is not to be omitted, becauſe I find it in the Regiſter of thoſe Lands which acknowledged the Lords <hi>Cobham,</hi> for Lords of the Fee: And when <hi>John de Cobham</hi> had obtained a Charter of Free-warren, in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, to all his Lands in <hi>Kent,</hi> The Mannor of <hi>Chillington</hi> is Recorded in the Catalogue amongſt them. After them, it came (as the Court-rolls and private Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of this place inform me) to acknowledge the Signory and Juriſdiction of the <hi>Mapelyſdens</hi> of <hi>Digons,</hi> and remained circumſcribed in their Revenue, till Queen <hi>Mary</hi> began to weild the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scepter, and then <hi>George Mapelyſden</hi> being entangled beyond all retreat, in the unſucceſſfull Expedition of Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat,</hi> miſcarried in that Attempt, and loſt his Eſtate by Forfeiture to the Crown, and Q. <hi>Mary</hi> granted it to Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> and <hi>Gervas Henley</hi> Eſquire, who not long after ſold his
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:103337:123"/>Intereſt in it to <hi>Nicholas Barham</hi> Eſquire, Serjeant at Law to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and his Succeſſor alienated this place to <hi>Hawle</hi> of <hi>Wye,</hi> whoſe Grandchild Mr. <hi>George Hawle</hi> lately deceaſed, held the Fee-ſimple of it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, within the Ambute or Limits of <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> ſtands an ancient Caſtellated Houſe called the Moate. It did in times of great Antiquity, relate to that Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which confeſſed the Signory of the noted Family of <hi>Leybourne:</hi> for <hi>Roger de Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne</hi> obtained the Grant of a Market weekly on the <hi>Tueſday,</hi> and a Fair yearly to continue three Dayes at the Feaſt of St. <hi>Croſs,</hi> in the fifty firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, as appears <hi>Pat.</hi> 51. <hi>Hen. tertii Memb.</hi> 10. But before the beginning of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, this Name was withered and ſhrunk into Decay at this place, and then <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Lord <hi>Burghurſt,</hi> or <hi>Burwaſh,</hi> Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and one of the firſt Founders of the Order of the Garter, came to poſſeſſe it, and Inhabited here in the twenty ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and poſſeſſed the Signory called <hi>Shofford,</hi> on which the Caſtle ſtands, and which one <hi>John de Shofford</hi> held by Knights-Service, in the twentieth year (as appears by the Book of <hi>Aid,</hi>) of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. After the Lords <hi>Burghurſt,</hi> the <hi>Woodvills</hi> were poſſeſt of it, and removed from <hi>Grafton</hi> in the County of <hi>North-Hampton,</hi> where they had long continued, and lived here. A fair Monument of <hi>Woodvill,</hi> on the <hi>North</hi>-ſide the Chancell of <hi>Maidſtone</hi>-Church affirms it: and when King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth created <hi>Richard Woodvill</hi> Conſtable of the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> a Baron of this Nation, and elected him into the Order of the Garter, his Style was, Lord <hi>Rivers, Grafton,</hi> and <hi>De la Moat;</hi> which Act of Grace and Favour, mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Sentence and Fine of 1000. <abbr>lb.</abbr> impoſed upon him, for matching with <hi>Jaquet,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Luxenbourg,</hi> Earl of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Widow of <hi>John Plantagente</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> without the Kings Licence. But when King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his eldeſt Daughter, being widow to <hi>Thomas</hi> Marqueſſe <hi>Dorcett,</hi> he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him Earl <hi>Rivers,</hi> and Lord of the Iſle of <hi>VVight,</hi> which Titles he had obſerved were concomitant in ſome of the Styles of the Lords <hi>Rivers,</hi> or <hi>de Ripariis,</hi> who were the Ancient Earls of <hi>Devon,</hi> and aſſumed to bear in an Eſcocheon of pretence upon his own Atchievement, the old Coat aſcribed commonly to <hi>Baldwin de Ripariis</hi> Earl of <hi>Devon, viz. Gules a Griphen Segreant Or:</hi> which I note for Criticks in Armorie to deſcant on, and return to the Hiſtorie of the Place. When this good man, for ſo he was noted to be, was miſerably maſſacred by <hi>Robert Ridiſdale</hi> Captain of the Lewd People of <hi>North-Hampton</hi>-ſhire, who took him at <hi>Edgcot-Field,</hi> and ſtruck off his head at <hi>North-Hampton</hi> (Their Will being their Law, and Miſchief Miniſter to their wild Deſigns?) all his ſeven Sons who ſurvived him, died without Iſſue, and then Sir <hi>Henry VVyat</hi> becomes owner of this place, Grandfather to Sir <hi>Thomas VViat,</hi> afterwards his Succeſſor in the Poſſeſſion of it, whoſe dyſaſtrous Tragedy is preſented at <hi>Boxley,</hi> upon whoſe untimely <hi>Exit, Hugh VVarham</hi> in the ſecond year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> by Grant from the Crown, enters upon it, from whom Alderman <hi>Rither</hi> afterwards Lord Maior of <hi>London,</hi> and known by the Name of Sir <hi>VVilliam Rither,</hi> Purchaſed and Repaired it and left it to his Daughter and Coheir, the Lady <hi>Suſan Caeſar,</hi> whoſe eldeſt Son <hi>Tho.

               <p>There was a Family Sirnamed <hi>de Maidſtone,</hi> whoſe Blazon upon a Monument in <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pinenden-Heath</hi> confines upon <hi>Maidſton,</hi> and is eminent for the Puniſhment of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, and the frequent Aſſemblies of Free-holders, who here convene to elect ſuch Perſons for Knights of the Shire, as may repreſent the County in Parliament. But it was in elder times more famous for that great Convention of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> who met there in the fourth year of <hi>Wil.</hi> the Conquerour, to decide the great Controverſie which then broke forth, between <hi>Lanfranc</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Odo</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> touching ſome Lands and Priviledges which the ſaid Arch-Biſhop alleaged were by an unjuſt Uſurpation by the above-ſaid <hi>Odo</hi> raviſhed away from the Church: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it gives us a full Proſpect of that exorbitant and wide power which the Clergie of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103337:123"/>thoſe times did entitle themſelves to. I ſhall endevour to pourtray it in as Brief and narrow a Landskip, as I have pencill'd it out by <hi>Textus Roffenſis,</hi> an old Book in Manuſcript ſo called, where it is more voluminouſly repreſented.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Pinenden-Heath</hi> (ſays <hi>Textus Roffenſis</hi>) in the fourth year of <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, there was an Aſſemblie of the graveſt and diſcreeteſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> by a ſignall Deciſion and Debate, to deternine of that Controverſie, which did formerly ariſe between <hi>Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> touching ſome Lands and Priveledges which were detained from the Church by the ſaid Earl; and <hi>Lanfranc</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The ſaid Diſpute or Debate laſted three Dayes: after the expiration of which, the ſaid Arch-Biſhop recovered ſeverall Lands which he the ſaid <hi>Odo</hi> and his Tenants then held, which were <hi>Herbert</hi> the Son of <hi>Ivo, Turold</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter, Ralph de Curva-Spina,</hi> and <hi>Hugh de Montfort,</hi> with all the Franchiſes belonging to them, as namely, <hi>Sac</hi> and <hi>Soc, Toll</hi> and <hi>Theam, Infangtheof</hi> and <hi>Outfang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theof, Flymena, Firmth, Grithbreach, Foreſtall, Heinfare,</hi> and <hi>Cerſett;</hi> (the laſt of which, becauſe none of our Interpreters of the dark and obſcure Terms of the Law do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, I ſhall; It was a Rent-charge of a certain Proportion of Corn in the ear, paid at the Feaſt of St. <hi>Martin,</hi>) with all other Cuſtomes greater or leſs, both on the Land and on the Water; and it was tried and proved by all the honeſt and wiſe Men both <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> who were preſent, that as the King himſelf, holds his Lands quiet, and free in his Demeaſne, ſo the Arch-Biſhop holds all his Lands whoily quiet and free in his Demeaſne. In the preſence of theſe, it was ſhewn by many and moſt evident Reaſons, that the King hath no Cuſtomes in the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but onely three, which are theſe. If any man digg in the Kings High-way, or cut down any Tree to ſtop it, if any man ſhall be apprehended and found Culpable, whileſt they are in doing ſuch things, whether Pledges be taken of them or not, yet by proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Kings Officer, and by Pledges they ſhall amend what is unjuſtly done. The third Cuſtome is, If any man commit Blood-ſhed on the Kings High-way; if whilſt he does it he be apprehended and impriſoned, he ſhall then make amends unto the King: But if he ſhall not be apprehended, but depart without giving any Pledge, the King may not in Juſtice require any thing of him. And it was at the ſame time farther determined, that if any Perſon did commit Blood-ſhed, or Manſlaughter, in places which were within the Liberties of the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> from the time that the Church left off to Sing <hi>Alleluiah,</hi> to the Octaves of <hi>Eaſter;</hi> that then he ſhould make amends onely to the Arch-Biſhop. And it was likewiſe ſhewed at the ſame Time, that whoſoever ſhould commit the Crime of Childwitt, that is, of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardy; if it were in Lent, the Arch-Biſhop ſhould have the whole Satisfaction; but if out of Lent, then he ſhould have onely half of it.</p>
               <p>There were preſent at this Aſſembly, <hi>Goisfrid</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtance</hi> the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, <hi>Ernoſt</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter, Egelric</hi> or <hi>Agelric</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Selſey</hi> and <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> a Man of deep inſight in the Conſtitutions Eccleſiaſtical, and of ſo great an Age, that he was brought in a Wagon, for his Diſcuſſion and Declaration, (ſays <hi>Textus Roffenſis</hi>) upon the known Laws, Uſages, Franchiſes, and Cuſtomes of Holy Church. <hi>Hugh de Montfort, William de Arces, Richard de Tunbridge;</hi> and laſtly, <hi>Haymo.</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Kent.</hi>

                  <hi>Town Malling</hi> and <hi>Eaſt Malling</hi> lie in the Hundred of <hi>Larkfield,</hi> and were both Mannors which related to that Revenue, which made up the Patrimony of the Nunnery of <hi>Town Malling,</hi> which was founded by <hi>Gundulphus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> about the year 1090, and dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and had the Church it ſelf which was likewiſe named after the bleſſed Virgin, and the Chappel of St. <hi>Leonards</hi> not far diſtant.

But after this I find no farther Remembrance of this Family at this Place; for in the ſecond year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, I diſcover by an ancient Court-Roll, one <hi>William Atweld</hi> to have held the Propriety of it: And in this Family was the Title lodged until the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then it was tranſmitted by Sale to <hi>Couper,</hi> and in the thirteenth year of that Monarch, I find one <hi>William Couper,</hi> to have diſcharged ſome Perſons of ſome Amerciaments, and Fines impoſed upon them for not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Suite and Service at this Mannor of <hi>Cheveney:</hi> and in this Family was the Intereſt ſucceſſively reſident, until the Beginning of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> and then this Houſe and Mannor being by the Cuſtome of Gavelkind ground into two Parcels, and thoſe poſſeſt by two Brothers Coheirs, one of them paſſed away <hi>Cheveney</hi> Houſe to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſden,</hi> in which name it is yet conſtant, and the other alienated the Mannor of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veny</hi> to <hi>Lone;</hi> from whom Mr. ....... <hi>Lone</hi> the inſtant Proprietary is lineally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted</p>

And endevouring to ſupport the prerogative of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, in an Age wherin his Crime was, too much Loialty, againſt the Aſſaults of ſome of the Factious and Ambitious Nobility, ſunk under the waight of their Hatred and Oppoſition: and being attainted of High Treaſon, this in the tenth year of the aboveſaid Prince Eſcheated to the Crown, and the ſame King in the thirteenth year of his Raign, granted it to <hi>John Hermenſthorpe,</hi> who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after conveyed it to <hi>Richard Fitzallan,</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundell,</hi> Lord Treaſurer, and Lord Admirall of <hi>England;</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Thomas Fitzallan</hi> dying without Iſſue, <hi>Joan</hi> one of his Siſters and Coheirs matching with <hi>William Beauchampe,</hi> who was created by Writt Baron of <hi>Abergavenny,</hi> in the ſixteenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, knit this Mannor to the Patrimony of that Family, where it continued till <hi>Richard Beauchampe</hi> this mans Son dying without Iſſue-male, in the ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed it to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Sole Daughter and Heir, who matched afterward to <hi>Edward Nevill</hi> Baron of <hi>Abergavenny,</hi> from whom the Title both of the Barony and <hi>Merworth,</hi> flowed down to his Great Grandchild <hi>Henry Nevill,</hi> who died the twenty ninth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and left this Mannor to <hi>Mary</hi> his Sole Daughter and heir, marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Sir <hi>Thomas Fane,</hi> unto whom King <hi>James,</hi> in the firſt Parliament which he held, Reſtored, Gave, Granted, and ſo forth, the Name, Style, Title, Honour and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Baroneſs <hi>le Deſpencer,</hi> and that her Heirs Succeſſively ſhould be Barons <hi>le Deſp neer</hi> for ever.

               <p>
                  <hi>Jotes-Court</hi> in this Pariſh of <hi>Merworth,</hi> had, as appears by ſeverall old Deeds, ſome without Date, Owners who were written <hi>Jeotes:</hi> and by contraction of the Name, call'd <hi>Jotes,</hi> but before the latter end of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, this Family was crumbled
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103337:126"/>away and gone, and then it came to have the ſame poſſeſſors with <hi>Merworth,</hi> as namely, <hi>Fitz-Allan, Beauchampe,</hi> and <hi>Nevill:</hi> the laſt of which who enjoyed it, was Sir <hi>Tho.

                  <hi>Swanton-Court</hi> is the laſt place conſiderable in <hi>Merworth.</hi> It lay couched in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue which related to the Knights Hoſpitalers, untill the publique Diſſolution ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted it, and ſurrendred it to the Crown, and K. <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth about the thirty ſecond year of his Raign, granted it to Sir <hi>Robert Southwell,</hi> who in the thirty fifth year of that Prince, conveyed it to Sir <hi>Edmund Walſingham</hi> of <hi>Scadbery,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor Sir <hi>Thomas Walſingham</hi> of the ſame place, hath lately paſſed away all his Intereſt here to his Son in Law Mr. <hi>James Maſters.</hi>

                  <hi>Roger de Merworth</hi> obtained a Market weekly, and a Fair yearly to his Mannor of <hi>Merworth,</hi> in the eighteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, as appears by an old originall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the hands of the Earl of <hi>Weſtmerland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Middleton</hi> is ſo called, by Reaſon it is placed in the middle of the Shire, and gives Name, to the whole Hundred, which is divided, into five Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lywicks, one whereof is called the Bailiwick of <hi>Shepey,</hi> becauſe it comprehends that Iſland. Antiquity has ſet a noble Attribute upon it, for in ancient Records it is ſtyled <hi>Regia Villa de Middleton,</hi> and here at <hi>Kemſley</hi> Downe, derived from <hi>Campſley, viz.</hi> the paſtures where the Camp was kept. Within the Pariſh of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton,</hi> is the very place, where, in the Time of King <hi>Alfred, Haſten</hi> the Dane, that ſo much infeſted <hi>France,</hi> arrived, and fortified in ſuch manner as he before had at <hi>Apuldore,</hi> where he erected a Caſtle, whoſe Fragments and Reliques are yet viſible.</p>
               <p>Our ancient Chroniclers inform us, that this Town, was in a good Condition till the Ragin of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor: in whoſe days, during the Diſguſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> ſuch as confederated with the Earl at home, burnt the King's Houſe here at <hi>Middleton,</hi> a caſtellated Pallace beneath the Church, whilſt he and his Sons ranſack'd and ruin'd many other places upon the Seacoaſts, and Skirts of the Shire.</p>
               <p>In Times of a latter Date <hi>John de Burgo,</hi> the elder, had a Grant by Patent of the Mannors of <hi>Middleton,</hi> and <hi>Marden,</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt: and after <hi>Margaret</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> had a Grant by Patent likewiſe in the tenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond; and after her, Queen <hi>Philippa</hi> Wife to <hi>Edward</hi> the third, had probably this Mannor in Dower, for in the nineteenth year of that King's Raign, as appears <hi>Pat. Anno</hi> 19. <hi>part. prima memb.</hi> 26. ſhe grants it for ſome term of years, to <hi>William de Clinton</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> with all the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties annexed to it, reſerving only ſome royal Franchiſes, which were ſo inherent to the Crown, they could not be ſeparated, for an Annual Rent of 200. <abbr>lb</abbr> 
                  <hi>per Annum;</hi> after his Time was expired, it reverts to the Crown, and there it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, for ought I can yet diſcover, till the Engliſh Scepter was put into the Hands of K. <hi>James,</hi> and then he grants the Mannors of <hi>Middleton</hi> and <hi>Marden</hi> for ever to <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> not long ſince deceaſed.</p>
               <p>There is within the Limitts of this Pariſh, a Mannor called <hi>Northwood Chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> which Name complies with the ſituation, for it ſtands North from the Town in a Wood, where Cheſt-Nut Trees formerly grew abundantly. <hi>Stephen</hi> the Son of <hi>Jordan de Shepey,</hi> deſirous to plant himſelf out of the Iſland, in ſome place not far diſtant; built here a Manſion-houſe, moated about,

He dyed in the thirteenth year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the firſt, and his eldeſt Son Sir <hi>John Northwood</hi> ſucceeded both at <hi>Northwood</hi> and at <hi>Shorn</hi> and in the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> the firſt, together with his eldeſt ſon Sir <hi>Jo. de Northwood</hi> was with that K. in his Wars in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at the Seige of <hi>Carlaverock.</hi> The Mannor of <hi>Shorn</hi> holding by this Tenure <hi>viz,</hi> to carry a white Banner forty Days together at their own Charge, when the King ſhould make War in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Sir <hi>Jo. de Northwood,</hi> was called by Writ to ſit in Parliament as Baron, the firſt of <hi>Edw.</hi> the ſecond, and his Son <hi>John de Northwood</hi> was often ſummoned to ſit as Baron in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in the raign of <hi>Ed.</hi> the third.

                  <hi>Edmund Hogſhaw</hi> in the eleventh year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Thomas Lovell,</hi> and he dyed ſeiſed of it, in the ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Thomas Lovell</hi> was his Heir; after <hi>Lovell, Greaves</hi> by purchaſe became entituled to the Poſſeſſion of it; whoſe Succeſſor <hi>Robert Greaves,</hi> in the ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, paſſed it away to <hi>Roger VVake,</hi> and this <hi>Roger VVake,</hi> in the fifteenth year of the ſaid Prince's Government, alienated by Sale his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in it to <hi>Richard Bernard;</hi> who ſome few years after, deveſted himſelf of his Right in it, and ſold it to <hi>Adam Henman</hi> of <hi>Lenham,</hi> where after the Title ſome few years had fixed, he in the twelfth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> conveyed it over to <hi>Amias Thompſon,</hi> and he gave it in Dower with his Daughter <hi>Alice Thompſon,</hi> to Sir <hi>John Tooke,</hi> from whom in the memory of theſe Times, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved by Deſcent, to his Son Captain <hi>Nicholas Tooke,</hi> who paſſed it away by Sale to Mr. <hi>Richard Tilden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then we have here ſecondly another place, which in ſome old Evidences, is repreſented under the Name of <hi>Nottingham</hi> Court, though now it bears the Name of <hi>Higham.</hi> It was the Reſidence of a noble Family called <hi>Nottingham,</hi> who were Owners of a large Patrimony in this Track, and their Armes ſtand yet in old coloured Glaſſe in <hi>Milſted</hi> Church, <hi>viz. Paly wavee</hi> of four pieces, <hi>Gules</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> The laſt of which, was <hi>John Nottingham,</hi> who expired in a Daughter and Heir, called <hi>Eleanor Nottingham,</hi> who by matching with <hi>Simon Cheney,</hi> ſecond Son of Sir <hi>Richard Cheney</hi> of <hi>Shurland,</hi> brought this and a large Demeaſne with it, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Signiory of that Family, in which Name without any Viciſſitude to tranſplant the Title it is fixed at this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Milton Septuans</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Weſtgate,</hi> was anciently a Pariſh,
<note place="margin">See more of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at <hi>Thurnham.</hi>
                  </note> and had a Church, appertaining to it, though now by diſuſe it be languiſhed into decay, and ſhrunk into ſo narrow an Eſtimate, that it has left only an Oratory or little Chappel, which is yet viſible to inſtruct us, what was its former Glory, which certainly was of no inconſiderable Account, when it was the Seat of the elder Houſe of <hi>Septuans,</hi> who made this their Reſidence. For <hi>VVilliam Septuans,</hi> Son of <hi>William Septuans,</hi> had here is Habitation, when he was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> which was in the fourth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond: but long after this Man, did it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Name of <hi>Septuans:</hi> for this Family, as to that Branch of it, which was planted at this place, ſhrunk into a Daughter and Heir, who was matched to Sir <hi>Francis Fogge,</hi> and ſo this place fell under his Revenue. And from him deſcended Sir <hi>Will. Fogge;</hi> whoſe Succeſſor Sir <hi>John Fogge</hi> of <hi>Repton</hi> Knight, paſſed this away to Sir <hi>George Brown</hi> of <hi>Bechworth</hi> Caſtle; in whom it remained, till this Mans Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child Sir <hi>Thomas Brown</hi> of <hi>Bechworth</hi> aforeſaid, partly ſold it, and partly gave it in Dower, with his Daughter <hi>Elizabeth Brown,</hi> to Sir <hi>Robert Honywood</hi> of <hi>Charing,</hi> whoſe eldeſt Son by this Match, Sir <hi>Thomas Honywood</hi> of <hi>Marks</hi> Hall in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> is now planted in the Fee-ſimple of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moldaſh</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Felborough,</hi> is a Branch of the Mannor of <hi>Chilham:</hi> but yet there is the Mannor of <hi>Flemings aliàs Bowers,</hi> for ſo it is ſtyled in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and Court-rolls, which deſerves our Notice. It was in the year 1019, as an ancient Court-roll, now in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Chapman</hi> does inform me, in the Hands of <hi>John de Fleming,</hi> and probably, here it remained diverſe years, though I can diſcover nothing, which may evince the certainty of it; for there is an Intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Gap in the Evidences. In the twenty fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, as appears by another ancient Court-roll, it was the Poſſeſſion of <hi>John Treſwenall,</hi> and in this Name it continued till the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; and then it was alienated to Sir <hi>Thomas Moile;</hi> in whoſe Poſterity the Title and Demeaſne was ſetled, till our Fathers memory, and then the Fee-ſimple was ſold away to Mr. <hi>Henry Chapman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſecondly, there is the Mannor of <hi>Witherling,</hi> who had Owners, who bore that Sirname, and who had certainly the Poſſeſſion of it, ſeverall Generations, which is manifeſt from that compliance the Name had with the Manſion, though the Evidence which I have drained from the Deeds and Muniments of this place, reaches
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103337:128"/>no higher then the Government of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth: for in the thirty eighth year of that Prince's Rule, <hi>Joan Witherling</hi> the viſible and only apparent Heir of this Family, tranſmitted her Intereſt in it by Sale to <hi>William Keneworth,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>William Kene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> by the like Fatalitie paſſed it away in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, to <hi>John Moile</hi> of <hi>Buckwell,</hi> Eſquire, extracted from the <hi>Moiles</hi> of <hi>Bodmin</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and this <hi>John Moile</hi> in the fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, ſold it to <hi>Hamo Vidian,</hi> a Name very ancient in <hi>Moldaſh,</hi> for here is a Farme which at this Day carries the Name of <hi>Vidian-Foreſtall</hi> and his Grandchild <hi>William Vidian</hi> at this inſtant enjoys the Fee-ſimple of it.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Newenden</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Selbrittenden,</hi> was erected in the place where the old Roman City of <hi>Anderida</hi> was ſituated, and was called by the Britons <hi>Caer Andred,</hi> very aptly by <hi>Leland,</hi> ſtyled in Latine, <hi>Noviodunum,</hi> from the Saxon, <hi>Nywandun,</hi> in Engliſh by Corruption called <hi>Newenden,</hi> which in the original imports as much as The new Hill in the Valley.</p>
               <p>This was that Station and City of the Romans mentioned in the Banner of the Count, or Lord Warden of the Saxon Shore, by <hi>Pancerollus</hi> in his Book called <hi>Notitia Provinciarum,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Anderida,</hi> and ſometimes written <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deridos;</hi> and here was the Caſtle which the Saxons called <hi>Andreds Ceaſter;</hi> and the great Wood, which ſtretched out in length, from hence into <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> 80. miles was named <hi>Andreds-wald,</hi> and by the Britons <hi>Coid Andred,</hi> other reaſons are laid down for the Identity of the place, extracted from the Name which the Engliſh Saxons gave it, who termed it <hi>Brittenden,</hi> that is, The Britons Vale, from whence the whole Hundred adjoyning is called <hi>Sellbrittenden,</hi> that is, The Britons Woody Vale.</p>
               <p>Here for Defence of the Coaſt, againſt the Eruptions of Saxon Rovers, the Romans placed the <hi>Prapoſitus Numeri Abulcorum,</hi> and hither the River of <hi>Lymen,</hi> long fince called <hi>Rother,</hi> was ſufficiently Navigable. But ſoon after the Romans deſerted <hi>Brittain,</hi> it ſhrunk into Decay, being ruined by the Engliſh Saxons; and yet a marke of the Loſſe, is covertly couched, under the Name of the principal Mannor, called <hi>Loſenham,</hi> of which ſomething is to be remembred, when we have done with the Hiſtory of this place, which I have thus abbreviated. <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully determined to expell all the Britons out of <hi>Kent,</hi> and thinking it would much conduce to the improvement of his Deſign, to recruite his Army with Troops of his own Nation, called <hi>Ella</hi> the Founder of the South-Saxon Kingdome, and his three Sons with a ſtrong Power out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and then gave a ſharp Aſſault againſt this <hi>Anderida,</hi> but was intercepted at that inſtant in his Deſigne, by thoſe vigorous Impreſſions, which the Britons out of their Ambuſhments in the Woods then made upon him. In Fine, after many Prejudices and Loſſes both given and taken: <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt</hi> divided his Army, and not onely diſcomfited the Britons in the adjacent wood but alſo at the ſame Time, forced the City by Aſſault, and became ſo enflamed with revenge, that nothing but the Extinction of the Inhabitants, by a publick ſlaughter, and the totall demoliſhing of the Town, could ſuperſede or allay ſo great an Animoſity. The place lying thus deſolate, was ſhewed (as <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> reports) many Ages after, to inquiſitive Paſſengers, till in the year 791, King <hi>Offa</hi> gave this and other Lands to the Arch-biſhop and Monks of <hi>Canterbury, ad Paſcua Porcorum,</hi> for the Pannage of their Hoggs.</p>

               <p>In the Time of the Conquerour, the Arch-biſhops and Monks of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> held this Mannor of <hi>Newenden;</hi> and it was rated in the extent of it, but at one Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and was an Appendage to <hi>Saltwood,</hi> and in the Patrimony of the Church did the Title of it remain locked up, till the general Diſſolution in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was unlooſned, and by Act of Parliament faſtned to the Revenue of the Crown, where, till theſe infortunate Times, it did ſucceſſively continue.</p>

                  <hi>Loſenham</hi> in this Pariſh, was the ancient Seat of the <hi>Auchers,</hi> an eminent and numerous Family; this was both in <hi>Kent, Suſſex, Nottingham,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex;</hi> where they made <hi>Coppt-Hall</hi> by <hi>Epping,</hi> the Seat and Head of their Barony, and it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable, they derive this their Name, from <hi>Aucherus</hi> that was Conſul or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman of <hi>Kent,</hi> and led the power of the County, wherewith, at <hi>Richborough,</hi> nere <hi>Sandwich,</hi> he foiled and defeated the <hi>Danes,</hi> as <hi>Alfred</hi> of <hi>Beverley</hi> writes. In the Book called <hi>Nova Feoffamenta,</hi> collected in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, it is there recorded that that Prince,

And if it could any way multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or improve the Eminence of a Family, that was ſo deeply rooted in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity before, I could tell you, that ſundry of this Name and Family, were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervators of the Peace, and concerned in other Comiſſions, both to levy Taxes, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Parliament, and to have Inſpection into Sewers, both in the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond: but I avoid the recital, leſt this Book might ſwell into too large a Bulk by theſe curious and unneceſſary Diſquiſitions. It is enough to inform you, that after this Mannor had for many Centuries of years been wrapt up in the Patrimony of this Family, it went away by <hi>Ann</hi> Sole Daughter and Heir of <hi>John Aucher</hi> of <hi>Loſenham,</hi> to <hi>Walter Colepeper,</hi> ſecond Son of Sir <hi>John Colepeper,</hi> of <hi>Bayhall</hi> in <hi>Pepenbury;</hi> from which Alliance, Sir <hi>John Colepeper</hi> created Lord <hi>Colepeper</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> by the late K. <hi>Charles,</hi> claims at this inſtant the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Lordſhip of <hi>Loſenham.</hi>

                  <hi>Tracies</hi> is a ſecond place in this Pariſh, which comes within this Liſt; it was in elder Times the Inheritance of a Family of that Appellation. <hi>John de Tracy</hi> was Teſte to an old Deed of <hi>Richard de Lucy,</hi> which I have ſeen, wherein he demiſes ſome Land to <hi>William de Frogenhall,</hi> the Deed is without Date; but by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Character ſeems to commence from the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third: Whether theſe <hi>Tracies</hi> were extracted from the <hi>Tracies</hi> of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> or not, I cannot poſitively determine, becauſe theſe of <hi>Kent,</hi> bore a different Coat from the other, as appears by all old Ordinaries, <hi>Vid.

               <p>
                  <hi>Frogenhall</hi> in this Pariſh likewiſe was a Branch of that wide Demeaſne, which lay diffuſed in this Territory, and did acknowledge it ſelf to be of the poſſeſſion of the Ancient Family of <hi>Frogenhall,</hi> whoſe Seat was in <hi>Frogenhall</hi> in <hi>Tenham:</hi> but whether this were the Land which I mentioned to be by Deed tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>William de Frogenhall,</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, by Sir <hi>Richard de Lucy,</hi> I cannot poſitively determine, though it was probable it was, and that afterwards, as was uſuall in thoſe Times, to perpetuate the Memory of the Poſſeſſor, <hi>William de Frogenhall.</hi> fixed his own Name upon it. And in this Family did the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion continue, till <hi>Thomas Frogenhall</hi> concluded in three Co-heirs, of which <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was one, who matched with <hi>John Northwood</hi> of <hi>Milton,</hi> and ſo linked it to the Inheritance of that Family, where it had not long remained when a ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable Fatality brought this Family likewiſe to expire in Daughters and Co-heirs; ſo that this place came by <hi>Joane,</hi> one of them, to be the Fee-ſimple of Sir <hi>John Norton,</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:103337:132"/>but was not long reſident in this Family; for he, about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, conveyed it to <hi>Thomas Linacre</hi> Prieſt, above mentioned, who dying in the ſeventeenth year of the above-recited Prince, gave both <hi>Tracies</hi> and <hi>Frogenhall</hi> for ever to augment the Revenue of <hi>All-ſouls</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mannor of <hi>Newington</hi> it ſelf belonged (as an Ancient Manuſcript, now in my Cuſtody, informs me) to a Nunnery which was erected here in this Pariſh, but by whom it was founded or endowed is unknown: only this Manuſcript I mentioned before, rehearſes a direful Tragedy, which it cites, as is pretended, out of <hi>Thorn</hi> the Chronicler of St. <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> and other old Manuſcripts: It was this. Divers of the Nuns being warped with a malitious Deſire of Revenge, took the advantage of the Night, and ſtrangled the Lady <hi>Abbeſſe,</hi> who was the Object of their Fury, and paſſionate Animoſities, in her Bed; and after, to conceal ſo execrable an Aſſaſſination, threw her Body into a Pitt, which afterwards contracted the traditional Appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Nun-pitt;</hi> but this barbarous offence being not long after miraculouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered (the Manuſcript does not intimate how;) King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, in whoſe Time this Tragedy was acted, ſeiſed this Mannor into his Hands, and having by Conſent of the Church tranſmitted the Nuns, who were culpable, to the ſecular power, by Death to make expiation for this Crime; he ſent the Guiltleſs Nuns into <hi>Shepey,</hi> and after filled their Cloiſter with ſeven ſecular Canons: four of which not long after (as if ſome ſecret Impiety had lurked in the Wals of the Covent) murdered one of the Fraternity; upon which the King ſeiſes this Mannor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into his Hands, which he had before given back to the ſupport of this new inſtituted Seminary: two parts of which laying in the Hamlet of <hi>Thetham</hi> by the two guiltleſſe Canons, with the approbation of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, were aſſigned to the Abby of St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> (though ſome Writings more Ancient affirm them to be given under the Notion of two Prebendaries to that Covent) by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror; and the other five parts of this Mannor, were by the aboveſaid <hi>Henry</hi> the third, granted to his Lord Chief Juſtice, Sir <hi>Richard de Lucy,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Almericus de Lucy,</hi> ſaies the Manuſcript, did in the year 1278. exchange them with the Monks of St. <hi>Auguſtins.</hi> And thus was this Mannor faſtned to the Patrimony of the Church, and ſo continued, till the General Diſſolution in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united it, and linked it afterwards to the poſſeſſion of the Crown, in whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſne till the Death of the late King <hi>Charles,</hi> it lay, ever ſince the firſt ſuppreſſion, involved.</p>
               <p>At this Pariſh of <hi>Newington,</hi> not long ſince were digged up many <hi>Roman</hi> Urns, not far diſtant from the high way or common paſſage, it being agreeable unto <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> practice to interre in thoſe places, where their Monuments might be obvious almoſt to every Eye, Memorials of themſelves, and Memento's of Mortality un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to living Paſſengers, whom the Epitaphs of great ones were fain to beg to ſtay and look upon them. Some of theſe were of a larger, and ſome again of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower Capacity, it being Cuſtomary amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> for the Servants and Clients to obtain Repoſitories for their Remains in Urns of a leſſer; for the Maſters and Patrons to ſlumber in Urns of a more wide and ſpatious Dimenſion: and many were ſo curious, that they contrived vaſt Family-Urns to continue their living Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, wherein the Aſhes of their neareſt Kindred and Friends, at leaſt ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of them might, as in ſome common Exchequer, be treaſured up, that ſo the Union in Life might be multiplyed and inforced by an amicable Correſpondence, even in the place of Sepulture; thus the Aſhes of <hi>Domitian</hi> were mingled with thoſe of <hi>Julia,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Achilles</hi> ſlept in the ſame Urn with thoſe of his <hi>Patroclus.</hi> That this Uſage or Practice of the <hi>Romans</hi> extracted its pedigree from <hi>Greece</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: For all Authors that have taken a Proſpect of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Rites of Funerals, conſent that thoſe of <hi>Megara</hi> ſhut up the Bones of four or five Perſons in the narrow Confines of one Repertory, or Sepulchral-Urn. It is farther obſervable, that theſe Urns diſcovered at <hi>Newington,</hi> were ſeveral of them embroidered with particular Inſcriptions; one had <hi>Severianus pater</hi> inſculped upon it, another was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſed with <hi>Priſcian,</hi> and a third with <hi>Fulvius Linus;</hi> this alſo was uſual amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> not only to ſuperſcribe the Names of thoſe whoſe Remains were lodged within, but likewiſe ſometimes to devote their Duſt to thoſe Deities they
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:103337:133"/>called Topical Gods, ſuch as were here, <hi>Deus Viterineus, Deus Moguntis, Deus Mounus, Dui Civitatis Brigantum, Camulus Deus Sanctus, Gadunus, &amp;c.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they endorſed <hi>D. M.</hi> that is, <hi>Diis Manibns,</hi> and then we often meet with <hi>Patera's,</hi> or Sacrificing Diſhes, Lachrymatories, Veſſels of Oile, and other Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Libations, which Age and a long Date of Time had condenſed into the Conſiſtence of Gellies; ſometimes again their Urns were placed or ſituated near ſome Bound or Land-mark, and then their Aſhes incloſed, were conſecrated to the peculiar Protection of <hi>Deus Terminus,</hi> and were cloiſtered in a Repoſitory or Veſſel, much in Figure or Reſemblance like a <hi>Roman</hi> Urn, but only the Cover was more wide and deep at Top, and this they ſtyled <hi>Arca Finalis.</hi> Beſides theſe at <hi>Newington,</hi> there are many other Examples of ſuch endorſments amongſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> I ſhall cull out ſome few, <hi>Marcus Plautius</hi> who ſlew himſelf for the Love of his Wife <hi>Oreſtilla,</hi> who deceaſed at <hi>Tarentum</hi> in her paſſage to <hi>Aſia,</hi> that ſo he might accompany her in Death, as he had done in Life, had his Aſhes blended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with hers in one Urn, whilſt this Superſcription without adorned their ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Duſt, <hi>The two Lovers.</hi> Not many years ſince there was digged up near <hi>Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geshall</hi> in <hi>Eſſex</hi> an Urn, which offered up to the Spectator's View this Inſcription, <hi>Coccilli M.</hi> that is, <hi>Coccilli Manibus.</hi> And not many years before at the <hi>Bath</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to publick Inſpection, an Urn, with this Endorſment inſculped, <hi>Vibia Jucunda An. XXX hîc ſepulta;</hi> I could diſcover more of this Nature; But I return. In theſe <hi>Newington</hi> Urns, as my Intelligence inſtructs me, there were traced out many peeces of <hi>Roman</hi> Coin, it being Cuſtomary amongſt that Nation, not only to incloſe Coin or Mony, both of Conſulary and Imperial Stamp, by which the Date of their Friends Deceaſe, might be hinted to an Intelligent Obſervation; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Fragments of thoſe Things the Deceaſed in his Life Time did particularly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as namely, Spear Heads, peeces of Darts and Swords, broken Armor, the Caſſis or Helmet, Shields, Goblets, Berill Rings, beſides a great Number of Gems, with Heads of Gods and Goddeſſes, and the pourtraiture of ſeveral Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, faſhioned out of Agat and Amber. Now if any will inquire of me, When this Cuſtome of burning the Dead, and after depoſiting their Duſt in Sepulchral Urns, became to be in Uſe amongſt the <hi>Romans?</hi> I confeſs I am ſatisfied the Time is incertain, though I dare poſitively aver, it was originally tranſported from <hi>Greece,</hi> where it was uſed though with more formality, long before it was adopted into the Uſages of this Nation. For firſt the <hi>Graecians</hi> burned only the Bodies of thoſe of more eminent Account, but denied it to thoſe who were of baſer Allay, or of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurer Fame; as likewiſe they did to deceaſed Infants; to thoſe who were blaſted or deſtroyed with Lightning, becauſe they ſuperſtitiouſly conceived them enemies to the Powers above; to thoſe who had impiouſly laid violent hands upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and laſtly, to thoſe who had by a perfidious Apoſtaſie, declared themſelves to be Deſertors and Betrayers of their Country. Secondly, they burned only the fleſh of the Body, reſerving the Bones to be laid up in Cheſts or Repertories, which they called <hi>Thecae,</hi> which amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> had the Title of <hi>Oſſuaria,</hi> beſtowed on them. Thirdly, they eſteemed it ſo great an Honor for any perſon to ſleep in his owne Native Countrey, that if he deceaſed in any Forrain Region, which was in Amity with them, they there, after their Cuſtomary Manner burned his Body, and with much Solemnity tranſported his Reliques to the place of his Nativity, and at every Croſſe Way had their appointed Feaſts, which were made at the Expence of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Friends of the Defunct, which they called their <hi>Compitalia.</hi> Laſtly, they ſtrewed Flowers on the Urns and Repoſitories of the Dead, and adorned them with Ribands, as they did the Urn of <hi>Philopaemen;</hi> but they more particularly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the ſtrewing of Myrtle, and Amaranthus, on the Aſhes of their departed Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did that of the Roſe; yet both of them did concur in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Funeral Pile, which was furniſhed and made up of Roſemary, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryx, Yew, Cypreſſe, and Firre, wherein it is probable were couched ſome tacit Hints of their ſurviving Hopes; and in which myſterious Hieroglyphicks, as being Trees which were perpetually verdant, were wrapped up ſome ſecret Inferences of a future Reſurrection. That this Cuſtome of Burning the Dead did afterwards by an univerſal Imitation extend and ſpread it ſelf to other Nations. That the <hi>Druids</hi> and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:103337:133"/>ruling Prieſts were accuſtomed to burn their Dead is expreſſed by <hi>Pomponius:</hi> That they held that practiſe in <hi>Gaule, Caeſar</hi> expreſly delivers: That burning the Dead was uſed in <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> is affirmed by <hi>Gaguinus:</hi> That the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Gothlanders</hi> did frequently commit their Princes and more eminent Perſons to the Fire, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by <hi>Saxo</hi> and <hi>Olaus:</hi> That this was the old <hi>German</hi> practiſe, is alſo aſſerted by <hi>Tacitus.</hi> And that it was cuſtomary amongſt the <hi>Danes,</hi> Several Urns, diſcovered in <hi>Jutland</hi> and <hi>Sleſwick</hi> not many years ſince, do eaſily evince, which contained not only Bones, but many other Subſtances in them, as Knives, peeces of Iron, Braſs and Wood, and one of <hi>Norway</hi> a Braſs guilded Jews-harp. When this Cuſtome of Burning of the Dead languiſhed into Diſuſe, is incertain; but that it began to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, upon the Dawning of Chriſtianity, as Vapors and Miſts ſcatter before a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sun, is without Controverſie; but when the Light of it did more vigorouſly reflect, like a <hi>Meridian</hi> Beam, on all the gloomy Corners and Receſſes of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm and Infidelity; then this Uſe of Urn-Burial, was wholly ſuperſeded, and found a Tomb it ſelf in the more ſober and ſeverer practiſe of Chriſtianity. And thus much ſhall be ſaid concerning theſe Urns digged up at <hi>Newington.</hi>

               <p>The Mannor of <hi>Levenoke</hi> in this Pariſh ought in the laſt place to be taken Notice of; but the Deeds being diſperſed into the Hands of thoſe who are Strangers both to this County and my Deſign, I cannot give the Reader that ſatisfaction in this particular that I aime at. Only thus much I can inform him, that by an old Court Roll in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Staninough</hi> of this Pariſh, lately deceaſed, I diſcovered that in the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, it was the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>John Beau Fitz;</hi> and it is probable by the Heir General of this Name, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved to <hi>Arnold</hi> of <hi>Rochester:</hi> and more to fortifie this, ſome ancient Country people at my being there, did aſſure me, they had it by Traditional Intelligence from their Predeceſſors, That that <hi>Knight</hi> purchaſed it of one <hi>Arnold;</hi> but of that there is no certainty, only this is poſitive, that about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, that Knight enjoyed it, and in this Name it remained until almoſt our Memory, and then it was conveyed to <hi>Gouldſmith,</hi> and he alienated it to <hi>Barrow,</hi> whoſe Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant having morgaged it to Mr. ...... <hi>Alſton</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> he very lately hath tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted all his Right by Sale, into Mr. ........ <hi>Liſle</hi> of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed.</p>

                  <hi>Nockholt</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Ruxley,</hi> was a Branch which was incorporated into the Revenue of the Lord <hi>Say.

               <p>There are two other Mannors in this Pariſh, but of ſmall importance, called <hi>Brampton,</hi> and <hi>Shelleys-court,</hi> or at <hi>Ockholt,</hi> both which had Owners, who engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their own Sirname upon them.

               <p>
                  <hi>Shelleys Court,</hi> called in the Evidences likewiſe at <hi>Ockholt,</hi> was, as high as the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, as the originall Deeds now in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Rob.

                  <hi>Nonington</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Wingham</hi> and <hi>Eaſtry,</hi> hath diverſe places in it of conſiderable Repute. The firſt is <hi>Fredville,</hi> called in old Deeds <hi>Froidville,</hi> from its bleak and eminent Situation. Times of an elder Inſcription, repreſent it to have been the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Colkin,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Cokin,</hi> who it is probable erected the ancient Fabrick, and brought it into the Shape and Order of an Habitation: this Family was originally extracted from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where they had a Lane which bore their Name, being called <hi>Colkins</hi> Lane, and likewiſe had the Inheritance or Propriety of <hi>Worth-gate</hi> in that City. <hi>William Colkin</hi> founded an Hoſpital neer <hi>Eaſtbridge,</hi> which celebrated his Name to Poſterity, and was called <hi>Colkin</hi>'s Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, he flouriſhed in the Time of K. <hi>John,</hi> and was a liberal Benefactor to the Hoſpitals of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> St. <hi>Katharine,</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Eaſtbridge</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as is recorded by Mr. <hi>William Somner,</hi> in his Survey of that City <hi>Page</hi> 116. But to proceed: <hi>John Colkin</hi> dyed poſſeſt of <hi>Fredvill</hi> the tenth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and in his Poſterity was the Title reſident, untill the latter end of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and then it was conveyed to <hi>Thomas Charleton;</hi> and he by a Fine, levyed the ſecond of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, tranſplants his Intereſt into <hi>John Quadring,</hi> in whoſe Name it made its aboad, untill <hi>Joan Quadring,</hi> the Heir General of <hi>Thomas Quadring,</hi> this man's Succeſſor, carried the Title along with her to her Husband <hi>Richard Dryland;</hi> and he about the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, alienated it to <hi>John Netherſole;</hi> who by Fine levyed in the ſecond year of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed it to <hi>William Bois</hi> Eſquire, deſcended from <hi>I. de Boſco</hi> or <hi>de Bois,</hi> ſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ſome old Copies of the Battle Abby Roll, and in others <hi>R. de Boſco</hi> or <hi>de Bois,</hi> who entered into <hi>England</hi> with <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, which <hi>William</hi> had Iſſue <hi>Thomas Bois,</hi> who dying in the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, left two Sons: to <hi>Thomas</hi> his eldeſt he deviſed <hi>Fredville,</hi> with his Eſtate there; to <hi>William</hi> his youngeſt, <hi>Bonington,</hi> and the Lands annexed to it: ſo that the eldeſt had the Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and the youngeſt the ancient Seat: from <hi>Fredville</hi> are ſtreamed out firſt the <hi>Boois's</hi> of <hi>Hode,</hi> the ſecond Branch of the eldeſt Houſe; Secondly thoſe of <hi>Betſhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> Thirdly <hi>Bois</hi> of <hi>Sandwich</hi> iſſued out from thoſe of <hi>Betſhanger.</hi> From <hi>Boning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> are extracted the <hi>Bois's</hi> of <hi>Willsborough,</hi> being the ſecond Branch of the ſecond Houſe; Secondly <hi>Bois</hi> of <hi>Offington,</hi> and thirdly <hi>Bois</hi> of <hi>Hawkherſt:</hi> From <hi>Thomas Bois</hi> above-mentioned is the Title of <hi>Fredville</hi> in a ſucceſſive Line now devolved to his Succeſſor <hi>Iohn Bois</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elmington</hi> is a ſecond place of Note in this Pariſh. It was made eminent in former Times, by being parcell of the Patrimony of <hi>Condye</hi> of <hi>Condies</hi> Hall in <hi>VVitſtaple,</hi> who likewiſe had ſome Intereſt in <hi>Fredville</hi> by purchaſe from <hi>Colkin,</hi> which <hi>VVilliam Condy</hi> paſſed away to <hi>Thomas Charlton</hi> above-mentioned. Which <hi>VVilliam</hi> was Son and Heir to <hi>Iohn de Condy,</hi> who dyed poſſeſt of <hi>Elmington</hi> the fifth of <hi>September,</hi> in the forty ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and by deſcendant Right was inveſted in the Propriety of this place, but enjoyed it not long: for he dying without Iſſue, <hi>Robert Grubbe,</hi> who had married <hi>Margaret</hi> Siſter and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heir of the aboveſaid <hi>VVilliam,</hi> entered upon the Poſſeſſion. But he likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding in two Daughters and Coheirs: <hi>Agnes</hi> one of them by matching with <hi>Iohn Iſaack</hi> annexed this to his Inheritance, and his Succeſſor <hi>James Iſaack,</hi> about
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:103337:134"/>the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, conveyed it to <hi>George Guldford</hi> Eſquire, who not long after tranſmitted the Intereſt, he had in this place by Sale to <hi>Betenham;</hi> in whom, the Poſſeſſion was but of a frail and narrow Continuance, for from this Family, a Viciſſitude like the former, about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, carried it away to Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hales,</hi> and his Son Sir <hi>James Hales</hi> not long after, demiſed it to <hi>VVilliam Bois</hi> Eſquire, Anceſtor to <hi>Jo.

               <p>St. <hi>Albans</hi> is a third place in <hi>Nonington,</hi> which exacts our Notice: It is called ſo, becauſe it was wrapped up in the Revenue of the Abby of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and did partake of the like priviledges as that Monaſtery enjoyed; a Scale of which you may read of, recorded in the late printed <hi>Monaſticum Anglicanum,</hi> too tedious here to recapitulate: It was in elder Times called <hi>Eſole,</hi> and was held by one <hi>Edmund de Akcholt,</hi> in Knights Service, whoſe Arms in <hi>Nonington</hi> Church, <hi>videlicet, Quarterly Argent and Azure, over all a Bend componee, Or, and Gules,</hi> are yet viſible and obvious: This Mannor upon the general Diſſolution, in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, being found involved in the Patrimony of the above ſaid Abby, was in the thirty ſecond year of that Prince, granted with all its Appendages to Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hales,</hi> and his Son Sir <hi>James Hales,</hi> about the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, conveyed it to <hi>John Sticker,</hi> who in the fifth year of that Prince alienated it to Sir <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> of <hi>Bedgbery,</hi> from whom not long after the ſame mutation tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted it into Sir <hi>Thomas Moile,</hi> and he demiſed the propriety of it by Sale to <hi>Thomas Hamon</hi> Eſquire, Aunceſtor to <hi>Anthony Hamon</hi> Eſquire, who now enjoys the preſent Signory of it.</p>
               <p>At the Borough of <hi>Wolwich</hi> in this Pariſh is a place called <hi>Oxendens,</hi> which was the Original Seminary and Fountain of thoſe of that Name and Family in this County.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ratling</hi> is another place in <hi>Nonington</hi> of principal Note: It contributed in Times of a more Venerable Date both Seat and Sirname to a Family of that Appellation. It would be too tedious and voluminous a Digreſſion to recite all thoſe whom Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Records repreſent to be the poſſeſſors of this Place; I ſhall only take notice of <hi>Sayer de Ratling,</hi> Son of Sir <hi>Robert de Ratling,</hi> who was the laſt of the Name who enjoyed it, and had it in Poſſeſſion at his Deceaſe, which was in the tenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and left <hi>Joane</hi> his Daughter and Heir, who was matched to <hi>John Spicer,</hi> from whom the <hi>Spicers</hi> who were Owners of the Mannor of <hi>Sherford</hi> in <hi>Monks Horton</hi> in this County, were collaterally extracted: but it appears they were of no long reſidence at this Place; for this Man and his Name together went out in Co-heirs; ſo that <hi>Ratling</hi> fell under the Dominion of a new Proprietary, for by <hi>Cicely</hi> one of them it was knit to the Demeaſne of her Husband <hi>John Izaack</hi> of <hi>Blackmanbery</hi> in <hi>Bredge,</hi> and by this Alliance the Title became tied to this Family, till <hi>Edward Izaack</hi> this mans Grand-child, in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, by Sale collated his Right in it on Sir <hi>John Phineux,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor in the next Age after, alienated it to <hi>Nevinſon;</hi> from whom not ſo many years are yet elapſed, but that almoſt our Memory may attaque the time of the Sale. By the ſame Fatality, the Poſſeſſion and Title was rowled into the enjoyment of the preſent Owner Sir <hi>William Cowper.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Oldcourt</hi> is a third place which may exact our Account, it was anciently parcel of the Demeaſne of a good old Family, who derived their Sirname from the Pariſh of <hi>Goodneſton,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Gonſton,</hi> by no far Diſtance removed from this place, and continued in an uninterrupted Series, from <hi>John, William,</hi> and <hi>Robert de God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſton,</hi> of whom there is frequent mention in private Evidences, and who flouriſhed in the Raigns of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, as their Dateleſs Deeds do intimate, until the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, poſſeſt of this place, and then it went by <hi>Edith</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>Edward Godneſton,</hi> in whom the Name was entombed to <hi>Vincent Engham,</hi> deſcended from the <hi>Enghams</hi> or <hi>Edinghams</hi> of <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church,</hi> from whom it went away by Sale to <hi>John Sydley</hi> Eſquire, Auditor to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, who added much to the Splendor and Magnificence of the <hi>Sydleys</hi> of <hi>Southfleet,</hi> by thoſe additional improvements, with which he encreaſed the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of that Family. When this Name went out, the next Family which ſucceeded in the poſſeſſion of this place by purchaſe, was <hi>Wild</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> deſcended ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:103337:135"/>from the <hi>Wilds</hi> of the County of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> where they are entituled to an Extraction of deep Antiquity, whoſe Succeſſor Sir <hi>John Wild</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in that Age we call our Fathers, paſſed away his Right in <hi>Oldcourt</hi> to <hi>Merſh,</hi> who holds the inſtant Fee-ſimple of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Northbourne</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Eaſtry,</hi> was given to <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by <hi>Eadbald</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> (as the Records of that Church do aſſert) after his Return to the Chriſtian Faith; for formerly by an open Deſertion or Apoſtacy, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced thoſe Principles of Religion, which originally had been infuſed into him. And being thus caſt into the Revenue of the Church, it remained incorporated in its Patrimony, till the publique Diſſolution made by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, diſſevered it, and laid it up in the Lap of the Royal Demeaſne, where it continued couched till Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> firſt granted it in Leaſe for Life, to her Foſter-brother <hi>Saunders,</hi> ſo he was ſtyled, becauſe his Mother had been her Nurſe, upon whoſe Deceaſe it reverts to the Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and King <hi>James</hi> upon his firſt Aſcending the Engliſh Throne, granted the Demeaſne to Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi>

                  <hi>Northfleet</hi> was alwaies a Branch of that Revenue which fell under the Spiritual Signory of <hi>Chriſt-church.</hi> By the Pages of Doomeſ-day Book, we may take a brief Proſpect of what it was in the Time of the Conqueror. <hi>Northfleet</hi> (ſaies that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord) <hi>in T.

I have ſeen a Deed without Date, which about the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, fixes the poſſeſſion of this place in <hi>John de Provender,</hi> and this agrees with <hi>Sidrach Petits</hi> Inquiſition, who in his curious Survey of ſeveral <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Mannors, taken in the twenty eighth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents this place about the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, to be in the Tenure of the above-ſaid <hi>John de Provender.</hi> After the <hi>Provenders,</hi> the <hi>Quadrins</hi> were Poſſeſſors, and then ſucceſſively the <hi>Goldwells</hi> of <hi>Goldwell,</hi> which was in the raign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, were Proprietaties of <hi>Provenders,</hi> and remained many years inveſted in the Signory of it, till the common Devolution of Purchaſe tranſlated the right of it to <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a Family of much Splendor, and no leſſe Eſtate in this Track: one of which Name, in the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, paſſed away his Intereſt in it by Sale to <hi>Robert Atwater</hi> Eſquire, Juſtice of Peace of this County in that Age, and he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it by Sale to Sir <hi>James Hales,</hi> Son of Sir <hi>John Hales,</hi> from which Family, in the Time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it went over by Sale to <hi>Sayer,</hi> in which Family, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Propriety ſome few years had reſted, it was almoſt within the Limits of our Remembrance, ſold to Mr. <hi>Hugiſon</hi> of <hi>Dover,</hi> in Right of which Purchaſe, after the Deceaſe of her Mother, it is to devolve to Mrs. <hi>Jane Hugiſon,</hi> deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

                  <hi>OFham</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Larkefeild,</hi> was Anciently divided between two Families <hi>Corton</hi> and <hi>Ditton: Richard de Corton</hi> held half a Knights Fee at this place, and paid reſpective Aide for it at making the Black Prince Knight, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Aide,</hi> in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Ralph de Ditton</hi> paid an auxiliary Contribution for the other Moity, which likewiſe was held by half a Knights Fee, at the Inveſtiture above-ſaid; but long it continued not to confeſs the Signory of theſe two Families: for <hi>Codwell</hi> which was part of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Offham,</hi> was alienated by <hi>Richard de Corton</hi> to <hi>Thomas de Godchepe,</hi> and he was in the enjoyment of it at his Deceaſe, which was in the one and thirtieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. After <hi>Godchepe</hi> had deſerted the Poſſeſſion, I find by ſome old Conrt-rols, that commence from the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, that one <hi>John Melford</hi> had the Poſſeſſion, not only of <hi>Godwell,</hi> but of <hi>Snodbean,</hi> and <hi>Pepingſtraw</hi> likewiſe, which his Father purchaſed of the Heirs of <hi>Ditton;</hi> but not long after this, was the Title of thoſe places reſident in this Family. For about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, I find one Moiety of them paſſed away to <hi>Browne,</hi> and the other to <hi>Colepeper:</hi> in <hi>Colepeper</hi> the Propriety remained, until the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and then it was demiſed by Sale to <hi>John Leigh,</hi> and he and Sir <hi>Matthew Browne</hi> the deſcendant of <hi>Browne,</hi> who was inveſted by Purchaſe in the other Moiety, exchanged the whole Mannor with <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and he grants it to <hi>William Wilford, John Bennet,</hi> and <hi>George Briggs,</hi> and they in the thirty ſeventh year of the above-named Prince, convey one Moiety of <hi>Offham, Snodbean,</hi> and <hi>Peping ſtraw,</hi> to <hi>John Tufton</hi> Eſquire, Anceſtor to the Right Honorable <hi>John Tufton,</hi> now Earl
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103337:137"/>of <hi>Thanett,</hi> the inſtant Poſſeſſor of it; And the other Proportion, in which <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> was included, to <hi>Richard Nortop alias Clerk,</hi> a Name vulgarly impos'd upon him, which was originally borrowed from his Office, as being Clark of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of <hi>Sherwood,</hi> in the County of <hi>Nottingham;</hi> yet this Name hath been ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed on his Succeſſors, that it is now grown the paternal Appellation of the Family, they having many years wrot <hi>Clerk aliàs Nortop:</hi> But I have digreſſed.

               <p>The vulgar Tradition of this Pariſh, is, that <hi>Jack Straw</hi> that eminent Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie of the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Commons in the raign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond (who with <hi>Wat Tiler,</hi> who was born at <hi>Dartford,</hi> were the two principal Emiſſaries, which did foment and manage that portentous Commotion, which then brake forth like an Inundation, and threatned to over-whelme the aboveſaid Prince) was born in a ſmall Cottage, at <hi>Pepingſtraw</hi> in this Pariſh, from whence he aſſumed his Sirname.</p>

                  <hi>Crofton</hi> in this Pariſh, did formerly ſwel into ſo much of Grandeur, and populacy that it was known for a Pariſh of it ſelf, till by Fire it was entombed in its preſent Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and by the Violence of that wild and impetuous Element, reduced into a Heap of Flame and Ruines; and certainly thoſe deplorable Remains which yet expoſe themſelves to an Inquiſitive Eye, and the Groundſells too, and ſcattered Foundations of Houſes, which the Plough often raiſes, out of their Sepulcher of Rubbiſh, and repreſents to the publick View, do evince this Truth to us, that Towns and Villages, have their ſtated Period of Duration, and muſt at length find a Grave like Men. But though this Village be ſhrunk into this diſordered Heap, yet ſtill it preſerves the Reputation of a Mannor, which it had anciently, when it was the Inheritance of <hi>Wibourn,</hi> a Family in elder Times of high Eſteem, and a conſiderable Revenue in this Territory. <hi>Ralph de Wibourn</hi> held Lands here, and in other places of <hi>Kent,</hi> as appears by ſundry ancient Deeds now in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Wibourne</hi> of <hi>Halkewell,</hi> in the raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt; and did after execute a Deed, for Land in <hi>Wrotham</hi> Hundred, in the tenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond.

                  <hi>Orlanſton</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Hamme,</hi> was the Inherirance of a Family of that Sirname. <hi>William de Orlanſton</hi> is regiſtred in the Liſt of thoſe <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Gentlemen, who aſſiſted <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, at the Siege of <hi>Acon. William de Orlanſton</hi> his Son
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103337:138"/>held it, in the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and obtained a Charter of Free-warren to it, in the one and fiftieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and more to improve the Grandeur of this his Mannor, with Additional Franchiſes, he likewiſe obtained a Market to be weekly obſerved here, and a Fair yearly, which was to continne by the ſpace of three Dayes, at the Feaſt of <hi>Holyrode,</hi> as appears, <hi>Pat. de</hi> 51. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>Memb.</hi> 10. The Grant of which Market was renewed and confirmed to <hi>John Kemp</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and after of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am de Orlanſton,</hi> this mans Grand-child, was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and had the Cuſtody of the County ſome part of the year following, and died the thirty eighth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and had Iſſue Sir <hi>John Orlanſton,</hi> who was Burgeſs for <hi>Romeney,</hi> as appears by ſome old Records in <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle, ſundry Times, both in the raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and matched with the Daughter and Heir of Sir <hi>William at Capell,</hi> from which Alliance proceeded <hi>Richard Orlanſton</hi> Eſquire, who died poſſeſt of <hi>Orlanſton,</hi> in the ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 16. and left his Inheritance to be divided between his two Siſters and Co-heirs, <hi>Margaret</hi> matched to <hi>William Parker</hi> of <hi>Parkers</hi> in <hi>Werehorne,</hi> and <hi>Joane</hi> eſpouſed to <hi>William Scott</hi> of <hi>Scotts Hall,</hi> who upon the Partition of the Ancient Patrimony, was inveſted in his Wife's Right, in this Mannor of <hi>Orlanſton;</hi> from whom the Clew of many Deſcents hath tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the Propriety to the inſtant Poſſeſſor, Mr. <hi>Edward Scott</hi> of <hi>Scotts Hall</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>Here were Lands divorced from this Place by no far Diſtance, called <hi>Oſwareſton:</hi> for I find <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Augie,</hi> gave to the Monks of <hi>Bermondſey</hi> in <hi>Southwarke</hi> his Lands called <hi>Oſwareſton</hi> near <hi>Romelin,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Lyda,</hi> and the Lands of <hi>John</hi> the Clerk in <hi>Bilſington,</hi> of which ſee <hi>Vincents</hi> Book of Nobility, <hi>Fol.</hi> 190.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Weſtbery</hi> in this Pariſh, was, as high as the private Evidences of this Place can give us any Proſpect to diſcover, the Propriety of a Family called <hi>Priſott,</hi> who was planted here as high as the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and tis probable much higher, though the Deeds reach no farther. Of this Family was Sir <hi>John Priſot</hi> the Judge, of whom there is frequent mention in our Law Books, which have an Aſpect upon the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and in this Name was the Title of this Mannor car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried down to the eighth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was by <hi>Thomas Priſot</hi> paſſed away by Sale to <hi>George Hount,</hi> in whom the Poſſeſſion had not many years been reſident, but the ſame Fatality brought it over to <hi>Reginald Strogle,</hi> who was in the Commiſſion of the Peace, in the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and was deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from a Family which was of a very high Original in <hi>Romney-Merſh,</hi> where there are ſome Lands yet which bear their Name. After <hi>Strogle</hi> had left it, it came by Purchaſe to Mr. <hi>Bennet Guildford,</hi> a Branch of the <hi>Guildfords</hi> of <hi>Hempſted,</hi> who in the beginning of the Raign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> falling under the Cenſure and Penalty of a <hi>Pramunire,</hi> for refuſing the Oath of Supremacy, and flying beyond Sea, forfeited this place to the Crown, and this Princeſſe immediately after paſſed it away by Grant to <hi>Walter Moile</hi> of <hi>Buckwell,</hi> from whom not many years after this original Conceſſion, it went away by Sale to Mr. <hi>Francis Bourne,</hi> Grand-father to Mr. ...... <hi>Bourne</hi> the preſent Proprietary of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oſpringe</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> was anciently a Limb or Appendage of the Royal Revenue, until King <hi>Edward</hi> the thind, in the tenth year of his Raign, by Royal Conceſſion or Grant, paſſed it away to <hi>John de Pultency,</hi> afterwards Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> to hold it in Fee of the Crown, by the Service of a Roſe, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up or preſented as a Symbol of Annual Fealty, and with this Mannor he granted him likewiſe all the Advouſons of-Churches, which formerly related to it, to hold in Soccage only by the former acknowledgement. In the nineteenth year of his Raign, the above ſaid Prince grants this <hi>John de Pulteney,</hi> that <hi>Thomas</hi> Son of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am de Dene</hi> ſhould be accountable to him for all thoſe Knights Fees which lay in <hi>Throuley, Boughton, Malherbe,</hi> and <hi>Wormeſell,</hi> and held of <hi>Queen Court</hi> and <hi>Oſpringe:</hi> de died poſſeſt of both theſe places, in the twenty fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, as appears, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 43. and left them to his Kinſman Sir <hi>Nicolas Loveine</hi> (though ſome part of the Demeaſne belonged to <hi>Poulteney,</hi> until the ninth year of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103337:139"/>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth) which Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> obtained a an Exemplification by Patent in the thirty eighth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, how many Knights Fees which lay divided and diſperſed into ſeverall places, belonged to his Mannor of <hi>Oſpringe;</hi> this Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> had Iſſue <hi>Nicholas Loveyne,</hi> and <hi>Margaret Loveyne; Nicholas</hi> her Brother deceaſed without Iſſue, and ſo <hi>Philip St. Clere</hi> of <hi>Aldham St. Clere,</hi> who had matched with this his Siſter, became his Heir, and ſhe was found to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of theſe places at her Death, which was in the tenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and in her Right did it deſcend with <hi>Queen Court,</hi> (which was leaſed out by <hi>Nich. Loveyne</hi> to <hi>Nicholas Potin,</hi> who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> the twenty firſt of King <hi>R.</hi> the ſecond, and held his Shrievalty at this place) to <hi>Thomas St. Clere</hi> who held it at his Deceaſe, which was in the twelfth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 46. But after his Departure, I do not find it long knit to the Demeaſn of his Family; for about the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, I find it in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>William Cheyney</hi> of <hi>Shurland</hi> Eſquire, and from him was the Title of <hi>Oſpringe</hi> and <hi>Queen Court</hi> derived by ſucceſſive Right to his Grandchild <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cheyney,</hi> who about the thirteenth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> paſſed them away to Mr. <hi>Rich. Thornehill,</hi> Great Grandfather to Mr. <hi>Richard Thornehill,</hi> Son and Heir of Colonel <hi>Richard Thornhill</hi> who is at this inſtant Proprietarie of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plomford</hi> and <hi>Bavell,</hi> are two little Mannors in <hi>Oſpringe,</hi> which belonged partly to the Nunnery of the <hi>Minſter</hi> in <hi>Shepey,</hi> and partly to the Abby of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> which upon the Suppreſſion of thoſe two Cloiſters, were granted by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, to <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> Eſquire, and he not long after, alienated them to Sir <hi>Thomas Cheyney,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cheyney,</hi> paſſed them away in our Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers Memory to <hi>Greenſtreet</hi> of <hi>Clacksfield</hi> in <hi>Borden,</hi> and are ſtill wrapt up in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of that Family.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maiſon le Dieu</hi> here at <hi>Oſpringe,</hi> was founded by <hi>Lucas de Vienna,</hi> for the Knights Templers, and was one of thoſe Manſions, where they repoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their progreſſe towards their other Demeaſne, which lay ſpread into <hi>Eaſt-Kent,</hi> and <hi>Romney Merſh.</hi> The Revenue which was to ſupport this Seminary, lay at <hi>Lurdenden</hi> in <hi>Challock,</hi> and at <hi>Hokeling, Radymerſh, Ryde</hi> and other places in the Iſle of <hi>Shepey.</hi> In the twenty fifth of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Roger de Lingſted</hi> had a Grant of theſe Lands, for Terme of Life, as likewiſe of all the Fiſhery Meſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, Relieſe, Revenue, and Homage appertaining to them, as appears <hi>Pat. Anno</hi> 25. <hi>Henrici tertii, Memb.</hi> 30. In the forty ſecond, and fifty firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, there was a Confirmation of Land and Priviledges to this Houſe, and in this Condition it continued, partly under the Knights Templers, and in lower Ages, under the Knights Hoſpitallers, untill the Tempeſt of the generall Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ſhook it into that neglected heap of Ruines, wherein at preſent the ancient Fabrick is viſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elverland</hi> in this Pariſh is a Mannor which for many Generations hath been annexed to the Demeaſn of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selgrave</hi> now corruptly called <hi>Selgrove,</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Oſpringe:</hi> It was a Branch of that large Inheritance, which lay ſcattered ore the Face of this Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and acknowledged the Dominion of the noble Family of <hi>Norwood: Roger de Northwood</hi> held it at his Deceaſe, which was in the thirteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 25. And tranſmitted it to his Son <hi>Roger de Norwood,</hi> after whom I do not find the Poſſeſſion was long permanent in this Family: for about the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Ralph de Spigurnell,</hi> was concerned in it as Proprietarie, and he bequeathed it to his Wife <hi>Elizabeth Spigurnell,</hi> who ſold it to <hi>John Winchelſey,</hi> and the Convent of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, in whom the Fee-ſimple continued, untill it was wreſted away by the Generall Diſſolution in the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: and then that Prince, paſſed it by Grant to <hi>George Barley,</hi> who not many years after alienated his Intereſt in it to <hi>Sonds</hi> of <hi>Throuley,</hi> from whom in our Fathers Memory, it came by Sale to <hi>Cleve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oſpringe,</hi> had anciently a Houſe or <hi>Maiſon le Dieu</hi> ſo called, becauſe it was a Receptacle for Leprous people, and other perſons afflicted and aſſaulted with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which in Times of elder Inſcription, were ſtill eſteemed to be impoſed by the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:103337:139"/>Finger of the Divinity, and this had a Confirmation of ample Immunities, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties by Patent in the forty ſeventh, and which were renued in the fifty firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Otford</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Codſheath,</hi> was given to the Church and Sea of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> by <hi>Offa</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians</hi> in the year 785, to expiate the Guilt of that Blood, which he had before drawn from the Veins of <hi>Aleric</hi> and his <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Men, in a Battell waged at this place, in the year 774, and which was aggravated becauſe thoſe he had ſlaughtered, had their Names enrolled in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of Chriſtians. And which was granted in the originall Donation, <hi>ad Paſcua Porcorum,</hi> to the Pannage of thoſe Hoggs that fed in the Arch-biſhops Chaſe; and in the Revenue of this Sea, was the Intereſt of this Mannor treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, till about the Beginning of the Rule of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; and then ſome envious Eyes looking about with Regrett and Deſire, upon the Diffuſed Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Church, <hi>William Warham</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to extinguiſh both the paſſions of theſe men, and their ravenous Appetite together, about the twelfth year of that Prince's Raign, exchanged this Mannor for other Lands, and ſo it became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into the Revenue of the Crown.</p>
               <p>There was a Chantry founded at <hi>Rye-houſe</hi> in this Pariſh, by <hi>Henry de Apul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfield,</hi> in the forty ſixth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, as appears <hi>Pat. Anno.</hi> 46. <hi>Edwardi tertii, Parte ſecunda Memb.</hi> 19. Whoſe Revenue upon the Suppreſſion, was by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, granted to <hi>Palmer,</hi> which Family had been of deep Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity before in this Pariſh, and from whence the <hi>Palmers</hi> of <hi>Snodland,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of <hi>Howletts</hi> in <hi>Eaſt-Kent,</hi> were originally deſcended: but it ſeems the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this royal Patent, could not reſcue it from being ſold ſome years after to <hi>Boſvill,</hi> whoſe Deſcendant now holds the inſtant Fee-ſimple of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Otham</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> was a Branch of that Demeaſne, which did in this Track acknowledge the Signiory of the ancient Family of <hi>Valoigns. William de Valoigns,</hi> is mentioned in the Book called <hi>Teſta de Nevill,</hi> to have paid Aid for Lands at <hi>Petham, Aſhford,</hi> and <hi>Otham,</hi> in the twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, at the marriage of <hi>Iſabell</hi> that Prince's Siſter, and it is probable that this <hi>VVill. de Valoigns,</hi> dyed poſſeſt of <hi>Otham,</hi> in the tenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, for his Name was <hi>VVilliam</hi> likewiſe, as appears by the eſcheat Roll, marked with the Number 54. after whom his Succeſſor <hi>Stephen de Valoigns,</hi> held it, who was certainly a man of ſome important Account in thoſe Times, for he was one of the Conſervators of the Peace, in the raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. After <hi>Valoigns,</hi> the knightly Family of <hi>Pimpe,</hi> was by purchaſe inveſted about the latter end of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, both in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Otham</hi> and <hi>Gore-court,</hi> and to this Name was the Inheritance both of <hi>Otham</hi> and <hi>Gore-court,</hi> by a Chain of ſeverall Deſcents, ſucceſſively united; till at laſt the ordinary Devolution of purchaſe brought them over to <hi>Iſley</hi> of <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drich;</hi> and within the Circle of this Family, was the Propriety of them circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, till the ſecond year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and then Sir <hi>Hen. Iſley,</hi> being fatally engaged and entangled in the unſucceſſefull Attempt of Sir <hi>Thomas Wiatt,</hi> could not unravell himſelf, untill he had ſatisfied the Juſtice of that Queen, with the forfeiture of his Life, and augmented the Revenue of the Crown, with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation of his Eſtate: from which theſe two places, as being parcell of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheated Patrimony, were by Patent ſoon after, paſſed away to Sir <hi>Walter Henley,</hi> one of the Serjeants at Law, to the aboveſaid Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who dying without Iſſue-male, bequeathed <hi>Gore-court</hi> to <hi>Hellen</hi> his Daughter and Coheir, who was matched to <hi>Thomas Colepeper;</hi> and <hi>Otham</hi> to his Brother <hi>Thomas Henley;</hi> from whom it is come down to <hi>Walter Henley</hi> Eſquire, who is the preſent Lord of the Fee: but <hi>Gore-court</hi> was by <hi>Colepeper,</hi> demiſed by Sale to <hi>Buffkin;</hi> where after the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion had for ſeverall years been fixed, it was almoſt within the Pale of our Remembrance, by purchaſe made the preſent Inheritance of <hi>Tho. Floyd</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stoneacre</hi> in this Pariſh is an Ancient Seat, which for ſome Centuries of years has acknowledged no other Proprietary then <hi>Ellys,</hi> but whether <hi>Burton</hi> in <hi>Kenington,</hi> or this Manſion were the original Fountain, from whence this Family did extract
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:103337:140"/>its firſt Etymology is incertain, for once they had one and the ſame Poſſeſſor. The Deeds that fortifie their Intereſt in this place, reach as high as the Time of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and inſtruct us, that <hi>Ellis</hi> which enjoyes it now, is by a ſtream of many unintercepted Deſcents iſſued out from <hi>John Ellis</hi> who poſſeſt it then.</p>
               <p>There was the Foundation of a Religious Seminary of Canons, <hi>Praemonſtratenſes</hi> or white Canons, begun at <hi>Otham</hi> by <hi>Ralph de Dene:</hi> but the Situation of the Place, being not accommodated to Health, they were by <hi>Ela de Sackvil</hi> removed and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into her new erected Priory at <hi>Begham,</hi> where till the common Suppreſſion they continued undiſturbed and fixed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Otteringdon</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Eyhorne,</hi> does repreſent to us in Proſpect the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of a Family, to whom it contributed in Times more Arcient both Seat and Sirname. <hi>Ralph de Ottringden</hi> held it at his Deceaſe, which was in the fifteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 29. But in his Son Sir <hi>Lawrence de Ottringden,</hi> both the Name and Male Line failed together, for his Daughter and Heir brought it along with her to <hi>Peyforer,</hi> who about the latter end of the raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, was extinguiſhed likewiſe by the ſame Fatality in <hi>Julian Peyforer,</hi> who was his Heir General, and ſhe, by eſpouſing <hi>Thomas St. Leger</hi> Eſquire, intermixed the Right of this place with the Inheritance of this Family, and who lies entombed in this Church, with this Compendious Superſcription endorſed upon his Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, <hi>Hic jacet Thomas St. Leger de Otteringden, qui obiit</hi> 1408. But a Revolution as ſuddain as the former, quickly ſnatched away <hi>Otteringden</hi> from the Patrimony of this Name; for by <hi>Joan,</hi> who was Co-heir to the above-mentioned <hi>Thomas St. Leger,</hi> it was rowled into the Revenue of <hi>Henry Aucher</hi> Eſquire ſprouted out from the Illuſtrious Stem of <hi>Aucher</hi> of <hi>Loſenham,</hi> and in this Family was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of this place ſucceſſively laid up till the Time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then the whole Demiſe was by Sale tranſmitted to <hi>Lewin,</hi> in whom a Deſcent or two after the Male-Line determining, the Female Heir brought it to <hi>Rogers</hi> of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> from whom the like Fatality hath lately devolved it to <hi>Charles</hi> Lord <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> eldeſt Son to the Right Honorable <hi>William Cavendiſh,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Putwood</hi> is another Mannor in this Pariſh, which in Times of elder Etymology, did acknowlede it ſelf to be under the Signory of a Family, who extracted their Sirname from <hi>Vienne</hi> in <hi>Dauphine</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and in ſeveral Deeds without Date, there is mention of <hi>William de Vienna,</hi> who was inveſted in Land here at <hi>Putwood</hi> and <hi>Oſpringe,</hi> and in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Lucas de Vienna</hi> paid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Supply, at the making the Black Prince Knight, for Lands which he held at <hi>Putwood</hi> and <hi>Oſpringe.</hi> After this Family was diſſolved and gone, the <hi>Quadrings,</hi> which was about the beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, were ſettled in the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where after ſome ſmall Reſidence of the Title, it went away by Sale about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, to the Ancient Family of <hi>Goldwell</hi> of great <hi>Chart:</hi> and here, after it had made ſome curſory aboad, the ſame Devolution caſt it into the Inheritance of <hi>Dryland</hi> of <hi>Cokes-ditch</hi> in <hi>Feverſham,</hi> to whoſe poſſeſſion after the Title had, for many years cleaved, it was tranſported by purchaſe into the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Atwater,</hi> ſo ſtyled, becauſe it is probable this Family had formerly their Reſidence near ſome Fountain or Stream, but their Original from whence they pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitively iſſued, was from about <hi>Oſpringe:</hi> for there I find <hi>Robert Atwater</hi> poſſeſt Land at his Death, which was in the fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and in this Name did the Title of the place lie couched, until the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then by Sale it was incorporated into the Revenue of Sir <hi>James Hales:</hi> but long it remained not thus mingled, for the Fate of purchaſe untwiſted it, and not many years after threw it into the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Sayer,</hi> from whom in Times which almoſt bordered upon our Memory, it was by Sale wafted over to Mr. <hi>James Hugiſon</hi> of <hi>Dover,</hi> and he bequeathed it to a ſecond Son, whoſe Female Heir Mrs. <hi>Jane Hugiſon,</hi> by lately matching with Mr. <hi>John Roberts</hi> Eſquire, eldeſt Son to Sir <hi>John Roberts</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> hath entituled him to the Propriety of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herſt</hi> in this Pariſh, was the Ancient Demeaſne of <hi>Filmer,</hi> and here were they ſeated, until by matching with the Heir of <hi>Argall,</hi> they were tranſplanted to <hi>Eaſt Sutton.</hi> I have ſeen an old Court-roll relating to the Mannor of <hi>Monkton</hi> in this
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103337:140"/>Pariſh, which by the Antiquity of it, ſeemed to commence from the raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, although the Date which ſtood in the Front, by the in urious Hand of Time, was almoſt expunged, and (ſo) hardly legible; wherein at the Foot of it, there is mention of one <hi>Edward Filmour,</hi> ſo he was written in that Age, from whom it is probable (though now the Name by Time and preſcription be in the laſt Syllable of it ſomething violated) the preſent Sir <hi>Edward Filmer,</hi> eldeſt Son to that Learned, Loyal, and Worthy Perſon Sir <hi>Robert Filmer,</hi> lately deceaſed, is primitively extracted, and this is confirmed by their own private Evidences, which repreſent them for many Cenerations, even till this preſent, Poſſeſſors of this Place, and wherein the Name is frequently written <hi>Filmor,</hi> aſwel as in latter Eſcripts <hi>Filmer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another Mannor in <hi>Ottringden,</hi> which anciently was reputed ſo, though now by Diſuſe and Intermiſſion it hath loſt that Eſtimate, and is called <hi>Hall-place,</hi> by a very Ancient Court-roll <hi>Sans date,</hi> now in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Paine.</hi> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, in thoſe Times, when it had Tenants and Services belonging to it, to be the propriety of one <hi>Roger Rev,</hi> and in that Roll there is mention of one <hi>Thomas Franklin,</hi> who held ſome Lands of this Mannor, by paying yearly the Tribute or Rent-ſervice of one Red Roſe, as the Symbol of his Homage. And now for want of farther Light, from the Ancient Deeds and Evidences; I muſt make a leap to the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and then I find <hi>Eugenius Cock,</hi> in the nineteenth year of that Prince, ſels it to <hi>John Bunce</hi> of this Pariſh Gentleman, in which Family the poſſeſſion reſted, until very lately it was by Sale alienated to Mr. <hi>Paine.</hi>

                  <hi>Monkton</hi> is the laſt place in this Pariſh of Note: It belonged before the ſuppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Nunnery of <hi>Davington,</hi> and was given to that Cloyſter by <hi>Matthew</hi> Son of <hi>Hamon Atfrith,</hi> upon the firſt Erection of it, which was in the thirty ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third.

And, thus regulated, was it for many Ages faſtned to the Patrimony of the Church, until the Diſſolution, in the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, unlooſned the Cement, in the twenty ninth year of that Prince; who afterwards about the thirty ſixth year of his Raign, grants this and divers other parcels of the Church-Demeaſne to Sir <hi>Thomas Wiatt,</hi> who not long after by Livery and Seiſin, paſſes away his Right in it to <hi>George Moulton</hi> Eſquire: but becauſe there was a Fine and Recovery wanting, the Sale was imperfect, ſo that he had it only in Abeiance (as the Law ſtyles it) or in Expectance, ſo that the Crown, in the ſecond of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> upon the Defection and Attaint of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Wiat,</hi> finding this in the Tenure of <hi>Moulton,</hi> ſeiſed upon it as parcel of <hi>Wiats</hi> Eſtate, becauſe it had not been before legally conveyed. And here it reſted, till Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the ſecond year of her raign, granted it to <hi>Anthony Weldon</hi> Eſquire, one of the Juſtices of Peace for this County under the raign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> at which Time he became eminent, by his vigorous oppoſing Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat,</hi> in that Deſign he was then embarked in; and in this Family (though not without ſome Struglings and Conflicts at Law, about the Title) does the Propriety of this Mannor at this inſtant reſide.</p>
               <p>There is an eminent Seat in this Pariſh called <hi>Roydon-Hall,</hi> which was before cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Fortune,</hi> but was of no great Account, until about the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then <hi>Roydon</hi> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> came into this County, and ſeated himſelf here, and erected this Pile, upon which he fixed his own Name, which it hath been known by ever ſince, though it hath changed its Poſſeſſor: for this Family was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in a Daughter and Heir called <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was the only ſurviving Iſſue of <hi>Thomas Roydon</hi> Eſquire, who by matching with <hi>William Twiſden</hi> Eſquire, made it the Inheritance of <hi>William Twiſden</hi> Eſquire Great Grand-father to Sir <hi>Roger Twiſden</hi> Knight and Baronet, who obtained a Charter of Free-warren from the late King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a certain proportion of Ground into a Parke which is that the Houſe is ſurrounded with at preſent, though the Houſe owe much of its Magnificence and Splendor to the Care and Expence of his Grand-father <hi>Roger Twiſden</hi> Eſquire, and his Father Sir <hi>William Twiſden</hi> Knight and Baronet.</p>

                  <hi>Eaſtmere</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Eaſt-Peckham,</hi> which acknowledged a Family called <hi>Remkin,</hi> anciently to be its Poſſeſſors: <hi>John Remkin,</hi> was Father of <hi>Chriſtian Remkin,</hi> who held it, as appears by an ancient Court-roll, in the thirty fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; and from him, did it, by paternal Viciſſitude, devolve to <hi>Nicholas Remkin,</hi> in whom the male-line failed: ſo that <hi>Alice</hi> his Sole Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter became the viſible Heir to his Eſtate, and ſhe by matching with <hi>Thomas Rolfe</hi> of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> knit this and other Land here at <hi>Great Peckham,</hi> to his Patrimony, but it did not long thus continue united, for <hi>John Rolfe</hi> his Son, in the ſixth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, conveys it to <hi>Richard Ruyton,</hi> and he in the eighth year of the aboveſaid Prince, alienated it to <hi>William Hextall:</hi> but he deceaſing without Iſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, <hi>Margaret,</hi> his Sole Daughter, by her Inter-marriage with <hi>William Whetenhall,</hi> originally deſcended from the ancient Family of <hi>Whetenhall</hi> of <hi>Whetenhall</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> caſt it into the Poſſeſſion of that Name, from whom it is now deſcended to my worthy Friend <hi>Thomas Whetenhall</hi> of <hi>Hextall</hi> Court, Eſquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spilfted</hi> is a fourth Mannor in this Pariſh: It was the Inheritance for diverſe Ages (as appears by the Evidences, now in the Cuſtody of Sir <hi>Roger Twiſden</hi>) of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Family called <hi>Cayſer;</hi> the laſt of which Name, who enjoyed this place, was <hi>John Cayſer,</hi> who went out in Daughters and Coheirs; one of which was wedded to <hi>Matthew Chetwind,</hi> to whom, this place, upon the Separation of the Eſtate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to parcells, in his Wifes Right accrued; and he after ſome ſmall reſidence in the Poſſeſſion, paſſed away his Right by Sale in the one and fortieth year of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> to <hi>Roger Twiſden</hi> Eſq. Grand-father to Sir <hi>Roger Twiſden</hi> Knight and Baronet the inſtant Lord of the Fee, a Perſon upon whom I need drop no other Character, when I ſay, that in theſe times, when there is ſuch a Damp, and Aſtoniſhment, by publick blaſtings and diſcouragements caſt upon Literature, He is both a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a Scholler.</p>

Now a Praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory was a Benefice in Kind, and was termed ſo; becauſe this, and all others of the ſame Capacity, were poſſeſt by the more eminent ſort of Templars, whom the Chief Maſter created and called <hi>Praeceptores Templi;</hi> A Commandry was ſome principal Mannor of the Knights Hoſpitallers, wherein was placed ſome Brother of the Order, who could not diſpoſe of the Profits of it, but was to mannage it only to the Uſe of the whole Fraternity, deducting ſo much of the Revenue, as might ſupport his Livelyhood and Subſiſtence, of which ſee more in Dr. <hi>Cowells Interpreter,</hi> in his Notes and Comment upon the word Commaundry.

And he had Iſſue by her <hi>Thomas de Columbers,</hi> who by his Deed dated at <hi>Pencehurſt,</hi> in the eleventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, paſſes away his Right in it to Sir <hi>John de Poultney,</hi> and he in the twelfth year of the above-mentioned Prince, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <hi>Pencehurſt,</hi> and in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, paid <hi>Aid</hi> for it, at making the Black Prince Knight; and held it at his Deceaſe, which was in the twenty third year of that Prince, and left it to his Son <hi>William Poultney,</hi> who immediatly after alienated it to <hi>Guy Lovain,</hi> who had Iſſue Sir <hi>Nicolas Lovain,</hi> who held <hi>Pencehurſt,</hi> in the forty fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and married <hi>Margaret</hi> eldeſt Daughter to <hi>John Vere</hi> Earl of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> re-married to <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Beaumont,</hi> and after to Sir <hi>John Devereux,</hi> Knight of the Garter, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Conſtable of <hi>Dover-caſtle,</hi> and Steward of the Kings Houſe, in the eleventh year of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond. In the ſixteenth year of whoſe raign, he had Licence by Letters Patents to fortifie and embattel his Manſion-houſe at <hi>Pencehurſt.</hi> His Daughter and Heir was matched to <hi>Walter</hi> Lord <hi>Fitz-water,</hi> from whom the Earls of <hi>Suſſex</hi> deſcended: and he had a Brother named Sir <hi>Walter Devereux,</hi> from whom the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and the Arms of this Sir <hi>John Devereux</hi> were not long ſince extant in a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, on the North-ſide of <hi>Pencehurſt</hi> Church; But he only enjoyed this Mannor in Right of his Wife, for after her Death it devolved to <hi>Philip St. Clere</hi> of <hi>Aldham St. Clere</hi> in <hi>Eightham,</hi> who married <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter of Sir <hi>Nicolas Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain,</hi> above-mentioned, Siſter and Heir to her Brother <hi>Nicolas Lovain,</hi> who died without Iſſue. And by her he had <hi>John St. Clere,</hi> who paſſed away his Right here to <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> third Son to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and he enjoyed <hi>Pencehurſt</hi> at his Deceaſe, which was in the fourteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth: but dying without Iſſue, it came down to <hi>Humphrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> fourth Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, who was ſtrangled in the Abby of <hi>Bury,</hi> by the procurement and practiſes of the Duke of <hi>Suffolke:</hi> and he likewiſe going out without Poſterity, it returned to the Crown.

                  <hi>Pepenbury,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Pembury,</hi> is ſeated in the Hundreds of <hi>Watchlingſton</hi> and <hi>Twyford,</hi> and contains within the Limits of it that noted Seat called <hi>Bayhall,</hi> which was the Ancient Seat of the Ancient Family of <hi>Colepepers.</hi> The firſt of which whom I find made eminent by Record, is <hi>Thomas de Colepeper,</hi> who was as appears by the Bundels of incertain years in the Pipe-Office one of the <hi>Recognitores Magnae Aſſiſae,</hi> in the raign of King <hi>John;</hi> a place, if we conſider the <hi>Meridian</hi> of thoſe Times, for which it was calculated, that is, before the eſtabliſhment of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervators of the Peace, of eminent Truſt and Concernment. And certainly this man was Father of that <hi>Thomas Colepeper,</hi> who was brought upon the Stage, and his Tragedy repreſented at <hi>Leeds</hi> Caſtle, where he was ſacrificed to the Anger of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, becauſe he was a more faithful <hi>Caſtellan</hi> to the Lord <hi>Badeleſmer,</hi> then he was a Loyal Subject to his Soveraign, and with his Life he loſt his Eſtate here at <hi>Pepenbury:</hi> Yet I find by the cloſe Rols of the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Memb.</hi> 5. that there was much of his Land here, and in other places, by the Indulgence of that Prince, reſtored to his Son <hi>Thomas de Colepeper,</hi> but yet the Mannor and this Seat remained lodged in the Crown; yet certainly it was no contemptible parcel of Land, that was granted back: for <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond by Royal Conceſſion gave Licence to <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> to incloſe fifty Acres of Land into a Park at <hi>Pepenbury.</hi> But to advance: In the twenty fifth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, the Crown deveſts it ſelf of its Right to both theſe places, and tranſplants it by Grant into <hi>Humphrey Stafford</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> from whom they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to his infortunate Grand-child, <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who loſt both his Life and Eſtate, being attainted in the thirteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: After his Tragedy, they continued until the twenty fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in the poſſeſſion of the Crown, and then they were paſſed away by Grant to Sir <hi>Edward Guldford,</hi> and again confirmed to him, in the twenty eighth year of that Prince's raign, and from him not long after by <hi>Joane</hi> his Female Heir, they increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Patrimony of <hi>John Dudley,</hi> after Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and he in the thirtieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, alienated them to <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> whoſe Story, Tragedy, and Attaint, in the thirty ſecond year of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Prince, are repreſented to our view in ſuch obvious Characters, that I ſhall not need again to unvail them. Upon his ruinous Cataſtrophe, they revert to the Crown, and lay ſhut up in the Royal Revenue, until the thirty ſeventh year of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the eighth, and then they were made by a new Grant the Inheritance of <hi>William Wybourn</hi> and <hi>Anthony Brown</hi> Eſquires; but that Proportion which was ſetled in <hi>Brown,</hi> was not long reſident in that Family; for in the ſixth year of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> it was alienated to <hi>William VVybourn</hi> Eſquire: nor was the Intereſt of theſe places of any long Date after this in <hi>VVybourn,</hi> for in our Grand-fathers Memory, the Fate of Sale annexed them to the Patrimony of <hi>Thomas Sackvill</hi> Lord <hi>Buckurſt,</hi> whoſe Grand-child the Right Honorable <hi>Edward Sackvill</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> not many years ſince conveyed his Right in them to Mr. ...... <hi>Amherſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Preſton</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Wingham,</hi> was the Inheritance of the Lord <hi>Leybourn.

Eſc. Num.</hi> 57. And <hi>John de Haſtings</hi> in the forty ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, which upon a ſerious Computation of Time, makes it impoſſible that this <hi>John de Haſting,</hi> whom all conclude to have been her firſt Husband ſhould be that <hi>John,</hi> who was Son to <hi>Laurence</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke;</hi> nor could it be any other <hi>William de Clinton,</hi> then this before mentioned. Firſt, becauſe he was the laſt Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi> of the Name. Secondly, if we ſhould make him to be any other, he muſt be deſigned Husband for this <hi>Juliana,</hi> after the Death of this <hi>John de Haſting,</hi> who ſurvived this <hi>Juliana</hi> ſix years, as appears by the former ballancing of Time, which will appear altogether abſurd and impoſſible. Thirdly, all do concurre, that this <hi>VVilliam de Clinton</hi> who was her ſecond Husband, was Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, in the twelfth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, Admiral of the Narrow-Seas Weſtward in the fifteenth year, and had the Cuſtody of all the Kings Forreſts Southwards beyond <hi>Trent,</hi> in the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of that Prince's Government, which could be no other, than this <hi>VVilliam</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> who although he were fruitful in Offices, he was not ſo in Children, for he dyed without Iſſue by this Lady <hi>Juliana,</hi> who after his death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the State of Widowhood (for ought I can yet diſcover) untill her deceaſe: for in the Eſcheat-roll mentioned before, ſhe is ſtyled <hi>Comitiſſa de Huntington,</hi> upon whoſe death, none appearing either directly or collaterally, who juſtly could enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle themſelves to her Patrimony, the Crown claimed it as an eſcheat; and <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, granted it to Sir <hi>Simon de Burleigh,</hi> Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, who being afterwards attainted, in the tenth year of that Prince it was re-inveſted in the royal Revenue, and was not long after by <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, granted to the Abby of St. <hi>Mary Grace</hi> on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> and ſome part of it to the Priory of <hi>Canons Langley,</hi> and ſometimes written <hi>Childrens Langley:</hi> and here it dwelt untill the general Suppreſſion, and then King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in the thirty fifth year of his reign, granted it to Sir <hi>Thomas Moile,</hi> whoſe Daughter and Coheir <hi>Amy Motle,</hi> incorported it into the demeaſne of her Husband Sir <hi>Thomas Kempe:</hi> where it had had no long aboad, when this Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> dyed without Iſſue-male, and left his eſtate to be divided between four Daughters and Coheirs: <hi>Anne</hi> one of whom, carried this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Sir <hi>Thomas Chichley,</hi> of the County of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Thomas Chich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> Eſquire, hath lately by Sale tranſmitted his Right in it, to Mr. ..... <hi>Spence,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Spence</hi> of <hi>Baukham</hi> in <hi>Suſſex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Preſton</hi> by <hi>VVingham</hi> had the Grant of a Market procured to it on the <hi>Monday,</hi> and a Fair of three days continuance, at the Feaſt of St. <hi>Croſſe,</hi> in the thirty fifth of <hi>Edw.</hi> the firſt. Sir <hi>Simon de Burleigh,</hi> had the Grant of a Market renued to this place on the <hi>Friday,</hi> and a Fair by the ſpace of three days at the Feaſt of St. <hi>Mildred</hi> the Virgin, in the tenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond.</p>

                  <hi>Petham</hi> gives Name in part, to that Hundred wherein it hath its Poſition, being called the Hundred of <hi>Bredge</hi> and <hi>Petham,</hi> and was always a Mannor folded up in

Robert de Valoigns</hi> had the Repute of a Baron in the thirteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and under that Notion held the fourth part of a Knights Fee of <hi>Wallingford</hi> Caſtle. <hi>Allan de Valoigns,</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the thirty firſt, thirty ſecond, thirty third, and thirty fourth years of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and held his Shrievalty at <hi>Swerdling.

William de Valoigns</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> the third, fourth, fifth, and ſixth years of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and his Son Sir <hi>William de Valoigns</hi> was engaged with <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt at the Siege of <hi>Carlaverock</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for ſome remarkable Service there performed, received the Order of Knighthood. <hi>Henry de Valoigns</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and he had Iſſue <hi>Waretius de Valoigns,</hi> in whom the Male-line failed, ſo that his two Daughters, (one matched to Sir <hi>Thomas Fogge</hi> Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child to <hi>Otho Fogge,</hi> who came out of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> into <hi>Kent</hi> about the Beginning of <hi>Edw.</hi> the firſt, and the other wedded to <hi>Tho. de Aldon</hi>) became his Heirs: and this upon the breaking of the eſtate into parcels fell to be the proportion of <hi>Fogge,</hi> in which Name after it had for divers ages continued fixed, it was in that Age we ſtyle our Grandfathers alienated to <hi>Spelman,</hi> and this Family not many years ſince determining in a Female Heir, it is now by matching with her become the Inheritance of <hi>Hadds.</hi>

                  <hi>Sapinton</hi> in <hi>Petham</hi> was the Inheritance of a Family called <hi>Bregge;</hi> for in the forty ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, I find <hi>Jo. Bregge</hi> conveys this Mannor to Sir <hi>Richard Atteleeze,</hi> and he dying without Iſſue, it deſcended to <hi>Marcellus Atteleeze,</hi> who was his Brother and Heir at Law; but he ſuddenly after expir'd, and with him the Name in Daughters and Coheirs, whereof <hi>Luce</hi> who was one of them, was firſt matched to <hi>John Norton</hi> Esq; and after to <hi>William Langley</hi> of <hi>Knolton,</hi> whoſe Heirs about the latter end of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, concurred in a joynt and mutual Bargain and Sale, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away their Intereſt in this Mannor; which was too much diſordered and ravel'd whilſt it lay thus mingled, to <hi>George Ballard</hi> Eſquire; from whom by the Clew of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages the Title went along to <hi>Nicholas Ballard</hi> Eſquire, who about the latter end of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> alienated it to <hi>Langford,</hi> and from this Name the four Brothers joyning in the Sale; in that Age which was circumſcribed within our Fathers Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, it was carried off by Sale to <hi>Cranmer</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whoſe Son Mr. ........ <hi>Cranmer</hi> is by Deſcent, ſucceſſively entituled to the preſent Propriety of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hauts-place</hi> in this Pariſh was the Fountain from whence that noble Family which fell under that Sirname originally ſtreamed out, which afterwards diſperſed it ſelf in ſub-divided Rivolets over the face of this County. <hi>Ivo de Haut,</hi> the firſt of this Name that ancient Record repreſents to us, is mentioned in a Book kept in the Exchequer called <hi>Liber de Terris Templariorum,</hi> which is a Survey of thoſe Lands that Order held in <hi>England</hi> in the year of <hi>Grace</hi> One thouſand one hundred and eighty; and there it is
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:103337:145"/>affirmed that he held this Mannor of <hi>Temple Waltham,</hi> and from this <hi>Ivo de Haut</hi> did the Title in a never-ebbing Current of Deſcent glide down to Sir <hi>William Haut,</hi> who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> in the ſixteenth year, and then again promoted to that Office in the twenty ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and not long after deceaſed, and with him the Name found its Funeral in two Daughters and Co-heirs, one of which termed <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was matched to <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> of <hi>Bedgebury</hi> Eſquire, to whom this place in the right of his Wife devolved. And from his Family in the Age within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of our Grand-fathers Remembrance, it was paſſed away by Sale to <hi>Salkeld,</hi> who not many years ſince conveyed the Poſſeſſion over to <hi>Bateman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a Chauntry founded at <hi>Depden</hi> in this Pariſh (as appears by a Manuſcript in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Thomas Den</hi> Recorder of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> lately deceaſed,) founded and endowed by <hi>William Gratian</hi> Prieſt in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth; Whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue upon the Diſſolution of this Chauntry in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, was granted to <hi>Jo. Come</hi> and <hi>Richard Almot,</hi> who not long after paſſed it away to <hi>Wilt. Forbraſſe</hi> Yeoman, a Name in ſome old Deeds written <hi>Fortbraſſe,</hi> which argues it to be of French extraction, and from this Family it was about the Beginning of K. <hi>James</hi> carried off by Sale to <hi>Gregory,</hi> who within the Verge of ſome few years faſt paſt, alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the Title to <hi>Sladden</hi> of <hi>Liminge.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Poſtling</hi> lies in the Hundred of <hi>Hene,</hi> and was, in Ages of a very high Aſcent, the Patrimony of the Noble Family of <hi>Columbers,</hi> a Name in Times of elder Cogniſance of very great reputation in the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>England; Philip de Columbariis</hi> or <hi>Columbers,</hi> held it at his Deceaſe, which was in the fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 5. But after him I diſcover no more of this Family at this place. The next that is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be Poſſeſſor of it, is <hi>Hugh de Audley,</hi> and he held it as appears by ancient Court-rolls in the raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and paſſed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to <hi>Delves</hi> of <hi>Delves Court</hi> in the County of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> where it ſeems it had no long aboad; for about the forty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>John de Delves</hi> alienates it to <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundell;</hi> for which the Earl is pardoned, becauſe he purchaſed it without Licenſe firſt obtained from the King as appears, <hi>Pat. de An<hi rend="sup">o</hi>
                  </hi> 43. <hi>Edw. tertii Parte ſecunda Memb. ſeptim.</hi> And in this Family was it for many Generations fixed and reſident; until the thirty eighth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was by Sale tranſmitted to Sir <hi>Anthony Aucher.</hi> But the Tenure of it in this Family was brief and Tranſitory; for about the Beginning of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> it went away from this Name to <hi>Robert Cranmer</hi> Eſquire, Nephew to <hi>Thomas Cranmer</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> who expiring in a Female Heir, ſhe brought it along with her to Sir <hi>Arthur Harris</hi> of <hi>Crixey</hi> in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> from whom it is devolved to his Son and Heir Sir <hi>Cranmer Harris,</hi> who holds the inſtant Poſſeſſion of it.</p>

                  <hi>Henewood</hi> is another Mannor in this Pariſh, from whence the <hi>Honywood</hi> of <hi>Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Pett</hi> in <hi>Charing</hi> do extract their Sirname: And <hi>Edmund de Honywood</hi> who in the raign of <hi>Hen.</hi> the third is remembred in the Front and Van of thoſe in the <hi>Leiger</hi> Book of <hi>Horton</hi> Priory, who were munificent Benefactors to that Covent, is ſet down there to have been of <hi>Poſtling,</hi> and as this Place was then, ſo is it ſtill through all that Flux and Decurſion of Time which hath ſince elapſed, wound up in that revenue, which acknowledges the Signorie and Jurisdiction of this ancient Name and Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pluckley</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Calehill,</hi> was originally a Mannor which owned the Arch-biſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for Lords of the Fee, until <hi>Lanfranc</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> gave it to <hi>William</hi> Brother of <hi>John de Cobham,</hi> who in the Grant is ſtyled <hi>Miles Archiepiſcopi;</hi> not that he was ever any Knight or Souldier that attended upon him; but that he granted him this Mannor to hold in Knights Service of him and his Succeſſors, which was very uſual and cuſtomary for the Arch-biſhops and other great Prelates to do; until King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt growing jealous of the Power and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the Clergie, who endeavoured by their Bounty and magnificent Donations to oblige both the principal of the Nobility and Gentry, and chain them up by theſe extraordinary Engagements to their Devotion, cauſed the Statute called <hi>Quia emptores Terrarum,</hi> in the one and twentieth of his raign to be made, which reſtrains and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:103337:146"/>ſuperſedes for the future all new Creations of Mannors. But to proceed, <hi>VVilliam de Cobham</hi> being thus enſtated in this Mannor, in Gratitude to the firſt Donor, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his Name from <hi>Cobham</hi> to <hi>Pluckley.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard de Pluckley</hi> this mans Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, flouriſhed in the raign of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and founded the Church at <hi>Pluckley;</hi> and from this man did <hi>VVilliam de Pluckley</hi> lineally branch out, in whom the Male-Line concluded, ſo that <hi>Agnes</hi> his Daughter and Heir, by matching with <hi>John Surrenden</hi> Eſquire, caſt <hi>Pluckley</hi> into the Poſſeſſion of that Name and Family: where it had not long ſojourned, when the ſame Viciſſitude brought it over to <hi>Haut:</hi> for <hi>James Haut</hi> wedded <hi>Joan</hi> Heir General of <hi>John Surrenden,</hi> and ſo became Poſſeſſor of <hi>Pluckley;</hi> but in this Name the Title was as volatile and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as in the former: for this man went out in Daughters and Co-heirs, one of them was wedded to <hi>Gouldwell,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the other was matched to <hi>John Dering</hi> Eſquire, in whoſe Right he was entituled to the Signory of <hi>Pluckley.</hi> Now if you will inquire, where lay the ancient Land of <hi>Dering,</hi> if my Aſſertion might be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, I ſhould affirm, that it was at <hi>Stamford</hi> by <hi>Hieth,</hi> where they were Lords of ſome part of the little Mannot of <hi>Heyton:</hi> for by an old Roll, I find that <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus de Morinis,</hi> married <hi>Kineburga</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>Deringus,</hi> and his Son as was Cuſtomary in thoſe Times, called himſelf <hi>Deringus de Morinis,</hi> and matched with <hi>Elveva</hi> Siſter and Heir of <hi>Alanus de Heyton,</hi> and ſo was inveſted in the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Mannor of <hi>Heyton,</hi> from whom it ſucceſſively came down to <hi>Richard Fitz Dering,</hi> who was Son of <hi>Dering,</hi> and great Grand-child to this man, who was the firſt who deſerted the Sirname <hi>de Morinis,</hi> and aſſumed that of <hi>Dering,</hi> and died poſſeſt of the Mannor of <hi>Heyton,</hi> in the forty ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. And from this <hi>Richard Fitz Dering</hi> is Sir <hi>Edward Dering</hi> Baronet, now lineally extracted, who is the inſtant Lord of <hi>Pluckley</hi> and <hi>Surrenden Dering,</hi> where Sir <hi>Edward Dering</hi> Knight and Baronet, not many years ſince deceaſed, raiſed that elegant Structure, as eminent for its Magnificence and Beauty, as it is for its Contrivance and Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pevington</hi> was formerly a Pariſh, and had a Church dedicated to St. <hi>Mary,</hi> though it be now languiſhed into Diſ-uſe, and grown an adjunct to <hi>Pluckley;</hi> The Patrons as well as Proprietaries of it were the <hi>Pevingtons,</hi> a Knightly Family, who borrowed their Sirname from hence. The firſt whom I meet with, is Sir <hi>Ralph de Pevington,</hi> who flouriſhed here, in the raign of King <hi>John,</hi> and King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and was Father to Sir <hi>William de Pevington,</hi> who likewiſe died poſſeſt of this Mannor, in the fifty fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, from whom deſcended <hi>John</hi> and <hi>William Pevington,</hi> who dying without Iſſue, in the ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Amabilia</hi> their Siſter, matched to <hi>John Gobion,</hi> became their Heir, and ſhe lies buried in the Church of <hi>Auſtin-Friars</hi> at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and is mentioned to have been a liberal Benefactreſſe to that Cloiſter, about the Time of her Deceaſe, which was 1405. and had Iſſue by him <hi>Julian</hi> their only Daughter, who was about the twenty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, matched to <hi>William Brent,</hi> from whom deſcended <hi>Thomas Brent,</hi> in whom the Name and Male-Line together was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, ſo that <hi>Margaret Brent</hi> matched to <hi>John Dering,</hi> was the viſible Heir of his Eſtate, amongſt which this Mannor of <hi>Pevington,</hi> was enwrapped, which came down in Right of this Alliance to Sir <hi>Edward Dering</hi> Knight and Baronet, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Deceaſe gave it after the Death of his Mother, the Widow Dowager of Sir <hi>Anthony Dering,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Henry Dering,</hi> the eldeſt Son by his laſt Lady.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Malmains</hi> in <hi>Pluckley,</hi> was the Inheritance of a Family of that Sirname. <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> Wife of <hi>John de Malmins</hi> died ſeiſed of it, in the fourteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 51. And after by Court-rols, I diſcover <hi>Henry Malmains</hi> to be poſſeſt of it, from whom it deſcended to <hi>Richard Malmains,</hi> who died (as the Date upon his Tomb-ſtone in <hi>Plukley</hi> Church diſcovers to us) in the year 1440. and left <hi>John Malmains</hi> his Heir, after whom I deſcry no farther mention of this Family; at this place: The next Family which ſucceeded in the Inheritance was <hi>Dering,</hi> not by any Right derived from <hi>Haut:</hi> for they had eſpouſed the Heir of that Name before <hi>Malmains</hi> was extinguiſhed: nor could it be by any Female Heir atchieved, for there were but two Co-heirs of this Branch of <hi>Malmains,</hi> who were wedded to <hi>Monins</hi> and <hi>Gouldwell.</hi> And if it be anſwered that <hi>Dering</hi> married the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:103337:146"/>Heir of the eldeſt Houſe: To that I anſwer, that <hi>Nicholas Malmains,</hi> who was of the elder Line, deceaſed in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 15. and left only a Daughter and Heir, who was matched to <hi>William de Grandiſon:</hi> ſo that it is evident by the Premiſes, that this Mannor of <hi>Malmains</hi> devolved to <hi>Dering</hi> the inſtant Proprietary, not by any match of <hi>Haut,</hi> or of this Family it ſelf, by any Female Heir or Coheir of <hi>Malmains,</hi> but by Purchaſe only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shurland</hi> is the laſt place of Account: It hath been the Patrimony of <hi>Betenham</hi> of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham</hi> in <hi>Cranbroke,</hi> for many Hundred years. <hi>Stephen de Betenham</hi> is mentioned in Court-rols, which take their Riſe or Date from the Government of <hi>Hen,</hi> the third: and certainly this is that <hi>Stephen de Betenham,</hi> which is mentioned to be one of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitores Magnae Aſſiſae,</hi> (an Office of very great Importance in elder Times) in thoſe Pipe-rols, which relate to the raign of King <hi>John;</hi> and from this <hi>Stephen</hi> hath the Title of this place, by a conſtant and even Chain of Ages, threaded together into an unbroken Succeſſion, come down to Mr. <hi>Betenham,</hi> who holds the preſent Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nory and Poſſeſſion of it.</p>

                  <hi>Plumſted</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Leſnes,</hi> was in the year of Grace 960. given by King <hi>Edgar,</hi> to the Abbot and Convent of St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> in <hi>Canterbury</hi> (as <hi>Thorne</hi> their Chronicler teſtifies) under the Notion of four ploughed Lands, which afterwards <hi>Godwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> violently tore from their Patrimony, and ſetled upon his Son <hi>Toſtius:</hi> but it was reſtored to that Seminary by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, and remained faſtned to their Revenue, until the rough hand of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, by a publick ſuppreſſion unlinked it, and then it was by that Prince, in the thirty ſixth year of his raign, granted to Sir <hi>Edward Boughton</hi> of <hi>Burwaſh-court,</hi> from whom it is now devolved by Deſcent to his Succeſſor Mr. ...... <hi>Boughton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Abbot of St. <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> to adde more eminence to this Mannor, not only obtained a Charter of Free-warren to <hi>Plumſted,</hi> in the thirty ſixth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third; but likewiſe by Grant procured a Market to be held here weekly on the Tueſday, and a Fair yearly three Dayes, at St. <hi>Nicolas, videlicet,</hi> the Eve, the Day, and Day after; both which were allowed before the Judges Itinerant, in the ſeventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plumſted</hi> had anciently Laws and Ordinances for the better ſecuring the Mounds and Banks of the Merſh, againſt the Eruptions and Inundations of the Thames, which almoſt were of the ſame Reſemblance and Complexion with thoſe of <hi>Romney</hi> Merſh. A Scale of ſeveral Statutes, are delivered to us by <hi>Raſtall</hi> in his Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which concerned the Inning and preſerving of <hi>Plumſted Level.</hi> The firſt was enacted in the twenty ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. and was printed. The ſecond was made in the fourteenth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and was never printed. The third was ratified in the twenty third of Queen <hi>Elizabeth Cap.</hi> 13. and printed. The fourth and laſt was confirmed, in the twenty ſeventh year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Cap.</hi> 27. and likewiſe printed.</p>

The <hi>Baſis</hi> is a great ſtone, it is not wrought; the ſecond Stone, being round, hath curiouſly wrought and and painted the Images of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Chriſt, Peter, Paul, John</hi> and <hi>James; Chriſt</hi> ſaith <hi>Ego ſum Alpha &amp; Omega; Peter</hi> ſaith <hi>Tu es Chriſtus Filius Dei vivi.</hi> The ſayings of the other three, were painted, <hi>Majuſculis Literis Romanis,</hi> but now obliterated.

The fourth hath the Image of our Saviour hanging and faſtned with four Nails, <hi>&amp; ſub pedibus ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taculum:</hi> The higheſt part of the Pillar hath the Figure of a Croſſe. In the Church is a very ancient Book of the Evangelies, <hi>in Majuſculis Literis Romanis,</hi> and in the Borders thereof is a Cryſtal Stone, thus inſcribed, <hi>Claudia Atepiccus.</hi> In the North-ſide of the Church, is the Figure of a Biſhop painted under an Arch; In digging about the Church, they find old Buckles and Rings: The whole Print of the Monaſtery appears by the old Wall.

The ſecond is <hi>Archers</hi>-Court, which gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family ſo called; one <hi>Nicolas Archer</hi> held it in the firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and ſo did <hi>Thomas le Archer,</hi> in the third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and left it to his Son <hi>William Archer,</hi> who paid reſpective <hi>Aide</hi> for his Lands here at <hi>River,</hi> and at <hi>Atterton,</hi> and <hi>Coperland,</hi> in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight. From <hi>Archer</hi> it came to a Family called <hi>Baudrede,</hi> and continued divers years in this Name, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til in the firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, it was conveyed by Sale with <hi>Coperland</hi> to <hi>Thomas Doilie</hi> Eſquire. Afterwards, in the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed with the Crown, and that Prince, in the thirty ſixth year of his managing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scepter, granted it to Sir <hi>James Hales,</hi> in whoſe Family it remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til almoſt that Time, which we entitle to our Fathers Remembrance, and then a part of it was paſſed away by Sale to <hi>Lee,</hi> but the other parcel continued conſtant to the Intereſt of <hi>Hales,</hi> until not many years ſince, not only that proportion, which was in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Lee,</hi> but likewiſe that other above-mentioned, were both alienated by their reſpective Proprietaries to Sir <hi>Hardres Waller.</hi>

                  <hi>Rodmerſham</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Milton,</hi> was the Inheritance of a Family, whoſe Sirname was <hi>Pine: John de la Pine</hi> enjoyed it, in the twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103337:149"/>third, as appears by private Evidences, and ſo did <hi>James de la Pine</hi> his Grandchild, who deceaſed in the thirty ſeventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and left it to his Son and Heir <hi>James de la Pine,</hi> a Child of nine years old, at his Fathers Exit; and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it untill the latter end of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and then it was tranſmitted by Sale to <hi>Podach,</hi> now called vulgarly <hi>Pordage,</hi> deſcended originally from <hi>John de Podach,</hi> who flouriſhed as appears by an ancient Pedigree, relating to this Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and held Lands in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> which bore his Name, and was called <hi>Podach;</hi> and from this above-mentioned <hi>Iohn,</hi> is Mr. <hi>Tho.

                  <hi>Pitſtock</hi> in <hi>Rodmerſham,</hi> is a little Mannor, which augmented the Revenue of the Nuns of <hi>Minſter</hi> in <hi>Shepey,</hi> but when that ruinous Tempeſt broke forth in the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, which like an <hi>Hurricano</hi> tore up by the Roots the Eccleſiaſtical Patrimony, this was ſupplanted and thrown into the Demeaſne of the Crown, and then the aboveſaid Prince, in the twenty ninth year of his Rule, granted it to Sir <hi>Thomas Cheyney,</hi> and his Son <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cheyney,</hi> about the thirteenth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> alienated it to <hi>Samuel Thornhill</hi> Eſquire, who upon his Deceaſe, gave it to his ſecond Son Sir <hi>Iohn Thornhill,</hi> from whom by deſcendant Right, it is now come over to his Son and Heir <hi>Charles Thornhill</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Newburgh</hi> is partly ſituated in <hi>Rodmerſham,</hi> and partly in <hi>Lingſted,</hi> and anciently had the Eſtimate of a Mannor, and gave Name to a Family that was repreſented to the World, under that Notion, as appears, by very old Deeds without Date, in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Bartholomew May,</hi> too tedious here to recite. In the twenty fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Iſabell,</hi> Wife of <hi>Henry de Apulderfield,</hi> held it at her Death, and in the Copy of the Inquiſition Roll, it is called <hi>Manerium de Newburgh:</hi> but in Ages of a more modern Complexion, it fell from its former Reputation, and by Diſuſe ſhrunk into Neglect and Contempt, and is now only eminent, in that it was involved in that Eſtate, that by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Coheir of Sir <hi>William Apulderfield</hi> devolved to Sir <hi>John Phineux,</hi> who finding his Sepulcher in Female Coheirs, <hi>Jane</hi> one of them, brought it over to her Husband <hi>John Roper</hi> Eſquire, and from him by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Efflux, is the Title now wafted along, to the right honorable <hi>Chriſtopher Roper,</hi> Baron of <hi>Tenham,</hi> removed by no wide Diſtance from this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Johns</hi> is the laſt Mannor in <hi>Rodmerſham,</hi> to be taken Notice of; though the Firſt in its Degree of Eminence becauſe it was a principal place belonging to the Knights Hoſpitallers. An Order that was eſtabliſhed and inſtituted by <hi>Gerardus,</hi> but fenced in, and empaled with New Orders and Rules, by <hi>Raimundus a Podio,</hi> leſt, debauched and ſoftned by ſecular Intereſt, in Decurſion of Time, they might have ſallied out into ſome Diſorder and Exceſſe. At their firſt Inſtallment, they were to be eighteen years of Age, at leaſt, and none who were without the Verge of that Time, were capable of this Order: they were to be neither of Jewiſh nor Turkiſh Extraction, leſt they might ſeem tacitly to wrap up thoſe principles in their Blood, which by their Vow, they were engaged to deſtroy. Their Pedigree or Genealogie, was to be wholly Chriſtian, and that of no coorſe, but of a more refined Temperament; for their Birth or Parentage was to be noble, and that not to be ſullied with the impure Tincture of Baſtardy. Yet even this Reſtriction had a gentler ſenſe quilted into it, for if they were the Natural Sons of Princes, their Birth was enobled, and the Rigor of the Rule, was by ſo eminent a Deſcent ſoftned and allayed, and they made capable of this Order. Then they were by a general Obligation, to defend the Sepulchre of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to protect Pilgrims, againſt the Eruptions of Infidels, in their viſits made to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> to foment no Clandeſtine Animoſities, by engaging in private Duells amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which were blaſted with the Black Character of Illegality; and if the Princes of Chriſtedome were entangled in inteſtine Diſſentions amongſt themſelves, they were to ſhroud themſelves, under an impartial Neutrality, leſt they might deſtroy
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103337:150"/>that Chriſtianity, which by Oath they were obliged to aſſert, if they ſhould embark in any impious Sidings, or partial Combinations. Laſtly, they were abſtracted by their Vow of Poverty, Chaſtity and Obedience, from all ſecular Employments, or Negotiations, leſt the Fumes of Temporal Intereſt might cloud their Eyes, in their proſpect towards the Sepulchre; in order to which, they were not to exerciſe any Mercantile Affairs, or the Deſigns of Uſury; they were, if poſſible, to receive the Sacrament thrice every year, and if not interrupted to hear Maſſe once a day. I have now done with the Ingredients which made up their Vow, I ſhall now come to the form of their Inſtallment.</p>
               <p>As for the Method of their Inveſtiture, it was caſt into this Mould. They had a Sword delivered to them, intimating they ſhould fight with Magnanimity; and this was guarded with a Croſſe Hilt, to declare that they were in all Encounters to vindicate and maintain the Croſſe and Sepulchre of our Saviour. Then they were ſtruck thrice over the Shoulders with that Sword they were inveſted with, to inſinuate, that they ſhould ſuſtain all Contumelies and Indignities, for the Cauſe and Defence of Chriſtian Religion. Then fourthly, this Sword was wiped, to inſtruct them that their Lives were to be aſſoiled from the Spot of all open and ſcandalous Impieties. Fifthly, they had guilt Spurs placed upon their Heels, to ſhew firſt, that all temporal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Wealth, was to be caſt behind the Deſigns of Piety and Religion; or ſecondly, to demonſtrate, that Riches were but the Gloſſe, or Parjet, but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Vertue, was the Solid Body, deſigned by the Spur it ſelf, that was to ſupport and ſuſtain it. Sixthly, they had a lighted Taper put into their Hands, by that, to diſcover, that by an eminent Integritie and exemplar Piety, like the Irradiation of that Luminary, they were to make themſelves conſpicuous to thoſe who were involved in the Miſts and Umbrages of a dark and gloomy Infidelity. Laſtly, after theſe Formalities performed, they were obliged to repair to Maſſe, where I leave them.</p>
               <p>Their Cuſtomary Habit was a black Cloak, being the beſt Enſigne, or Symptome of a ſolemne external Sorrow, and on this was a <hi>Croſſe potent between four Croſſes Patee,</hi> deſigning the five wounds of our Saviour; they wore conſtantly when they appeared in publique, a red Belt, intimating they were at all times ready to bleed, in Defence of the Croſſe and Sepulcher, and on that was fixed a white Croſſe, to manifeſt the Purity and Innocence of that Cauſe and Religion which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for.</p>
               <p>This Order was firſt brought into <hi>England,</hi> in the year of <hi>Grace</hi> 1100, by <hi>Jordan de Briſet,</hi> in ſome old Deeds written <hi>Brinſet,</hi> Lord of <hi>Well-hall</hi> at <hi>Eltham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>Muriell</hi> his Wife, who founded a Houſe for them at <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> and dedicated it to St. <hi>John,</hi> which afterwards became the Head of their <hi>Alberge</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> to which this Mannor continued united, as parcell of their Demeaſne, untill the Diſſolution in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, like a general Deluge, ſwept it away, and tranſported it into the Revenue of the Crown, and that Prince by Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, made it the Eſtate of <hi>William Pordage</hi> Eſquire, in whoſe Deſcendant, <hi>Thomas Pordage</hi> Eſquire, the preſent Inheritance of it remains at this inſtant placed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rocheſter</hi> is a City which in elder Times, was as eminent for its Antiquity, as it was for its Strength and Grandeur; and had not thoſe violent Impreſſions, which the rough hand of War formerly defaced it with, demoliſhed its Bulke, and diſcompoſed its Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it peradventure might have been regiſtred at this day in the Inventory of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cities of this Nation. It was governed by a Port Reve, until King <hi>Edw.</hi> the fourth, in the ſecond year of his Reign, raiſed it into a higher Dignity, and decreed by his royal Grant, that it ſhould thenceforth be governed by a Maior and twelve Aldermen, and to this Monarch does this City owe much of its preſent Felicity, a Prince certainly he was, full of Complacence and Benignity, of a munificent Mind, and an obliging accoſtable Nature, guilty onely of ſome humane Frailties, common to all, and adorned with many ſignal Virtues, ſcarce reſident in any one, who did not voluntarily ſail into that Sea of Blood, which was let looſe in the Civil War, commenced between Him, and the Partiſans of the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> but rather was driven into it, by the Tempeſt of his ill Fortune.</p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:103337:150"/>
               <p>Having repreſented the City in its Modern Face or Aſpect, I ſhall now draw the Curtain ſomething wider, and diſcover its Pourtracture in its calamitous Sufferings, occaſioned by the Invaſions, not only of an entaged Enemy, but likewiſe, which is worſe, by the Onſets of its own incenſed Prince; and theſe two mixing together have much diſordered the Ancient Glory and Splendor of it.</p>
               <p>In the year 680. <hi>Eldred</hi> King of <hi>Mercia</hi> harraſſed <hi>Kent,</hi> and by an impetuous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road laid it waſt. And as particular Lamentations are not diſtinguiſhable in univerſal Groans; ſo in this publick Depopulation of the County (then Kingdome,) the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy and Devaſtation acted by that Prince, at that Time, upon this City, was not reſented with that Regret, as ſo deplorable Ruine might ſeem to exact, which had it been ſingly poured out upon this City, it could not have been repeated or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed without a bleeding Heart, and a weeping Eye.</p>
               <p>In the year 986. King <hi>Etheldred</hi> infeſted <hi>Rocheſter</hi> with a Siege, having entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome diſcontent or diſguſt againſt the Biſhop, and would not diſſolve his Leaguer, until the ſaid Biſhop had expiated his Offence with the Sacrifice of an hundred pounds, a Sum of importance in thoſe dry Times, though inconſiderable in theſe profuſer ones of ours, where commonly the pecuniary Supply, that is extracted from the Subject, is ſteeped in his Tears.</p>
               <p>In the year 999. the <hi>Danes</hi> invaded <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and though by the vigorous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and Magnanimity of the Defendants, their Aſſaults were made null, yet at length by the treacherous Combination of an inſidious Party within, it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther betrayed then ſubdued, and miſerably depopulated by the Barbarous Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, the Signatures of which Devaſtation are yet viſible: and though the wideneſs of the Orifice, which that wound had made, be ſomething cloſed up with the Hand of Time, yet there is a huge Scar left, to repreſent to Poſterity the Greatneſs of the former Ruine. After they had thus harraſſed and defaced that City, they (to improve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>heir Victory) advanced to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> where the Inhabitants aſtoniſhed with an Example of ſo much Terror, after ſome faint Oppoſition againſt the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and Onſets, gave themſelves up to Flight, and this City to a Calamitous Depopulation.</p>
               <p>In the year 1130. <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, with the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Conſecration of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Church in <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> which was then brought to perfection, having been before much empaired by the Iron Teeth of Time: But then the Fury of the Elements began to enter into a Corrivalſhip or Competition with the Fury of Enemies; for by a caſual Eruption of an Accidental Fire, the whole City almoſt found an infortunate Sepulchre in its own Aſhes: But it ſeems like a Phaenix, it roſe again into new Beauty and Order out of theſe Aſhes and Embers, but did not long continue in this Condition; for in the year of Grace 1177. which was in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, it was again aſſaulted by the Outrage and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this implacable Element, the Impreſſions and remaining Signatures of which Conflagration, are obvious to the Inſpection of an Inquiſitive Eye, even until this Day.</p>
               <p>In the year 1225. it was by the Indulgent Bounty of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a Wall, and that this Fortification might be of more Concernment, it was likewiſe ſecured or fenced with a Ditch.</p>
               <p>In the year 1251. A Solemn Tornament was held at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> wherein the <hi>Engliſh</hi> entered the Liſts againſt thoſe Strangers or Forrainers, (who having in that Age a great Concernment in the Eare of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, had likewiſe a ſtrong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his Heart, and by conſequence a powerful Impreſſion or Influence upon the publick Affairs of thoſe Times) wherein they managed the Honor of this Nation, with ſo much Courage and Gallantry, that they forced them with Shame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion to retire into the City, and as if that were not a Shelter of ſufficient Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to ſeek for their Security in the Caſtle.</p>

                  <p>THat there was in the Age before the <hi>Norman</hi> Invaſion, the Rudiments, or, if I may ſo ſay, the <hi>Embrio</hi> of a Caſtle repreſented to the World under imperfect Lineaments or Dimenſions, here at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> is moſt certain; For the Records of the Cathedral inform us, that <hi>Egbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the year 763. gave cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lands to <hi>Eardulfe,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> ſituate within the Wals of the Caſtle of that City, which argues that there was ſome Trench or Fortification, even in thoſe Times, which was in Strength by the Analogy of Proportion equivalent to the Fortreſſes of that Age, and ſo might merit by Reſemblance the Name of a Caſtle, though the Bulk and Grandeur of it was added in Times of a more Modern extraction: For in the Time of the Conqueſt, I find that the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> received Land at <hi>Alresford</hi> for Land at <hi>Rocheſter</hi> proportionate to it to erect a Caſtle on, which was in all probability, onely to enlarge the Boundaries of the old one, which peradventure was thought too contemptible in thoſe active Times, to ſecure ſo important a Paſs, as this of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> was, without the Additional Supply of ſome new Strength. And that theſe Augmentations did acknowledge, if not for their Founder or Author, yet at leaſt for their eminent Benefactor, <hi>Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bajeux,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> half Brother to the Conqueror, is without Controverſie; a man who was afterwards dignified and adorned with the Office of Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> a place of the moſt eminent Truſt in that Age, and which was often managed by the Kings of <hi>England</hi> perſonally themſelves, and from the Marble Seat in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> did deliver their Deciſions and Determinations of Law, from whence in Ancient Seals and other Sculptures, they are often repreſented to us ſitting in Judicature upon this Marble Seat, and hence reſult thoſe Cuſtomary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in Original Writs, and other Proceſſes, <hi>Coram Nobis,</hi> and, <hi>Teſte Rege,</hi> and ſometimes, <hi>me Ipſo apud Weſtmon.</hi> and ſome other Phraſes and Tearms in our Ancient Law-books of the ſame Complexion, as namely ſuch a one, <hi>Allocutus eſt Nobis ſedentibus ſupra Sedem Marmoream:</hi> which juſtifies that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did ſometimes perſonally ſit and aſſiſt in Judicature, in that Court we now call the Upper Bench, where like a great Orb or Glob of Light, they diſperſed their Beams of Mercy and Juſtice into all the parts of our <hi>Engliſh Horizon,</hi> and diſpelled all thoſe Crievances, which, like ſo many Fogs or Clouds exhaled from corrupred Nature, ſeemed to eclipſe the Serenity of this Nation. But I wander too much; I now return. This Accumulation of Offices and Dignities, could not ſo ingage this above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Odo,</hi> to the Intereſt of <hi>William Rufus</hi> his Nephew; but that he firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped himſelf in a Combination with ſome of the diſcontented Nobility, whoſe Endeavors were to raviſh the Scepter out of the Hand of that Prince, and place it in the hand of <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> his eldeſt Brother, and afterwards to fortifie this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, ſtarted out into an open Defection and ſeiſed upon this Caſtle of <hi>Rocheſter:</hi> but <hi>William Rufus</hi> with ſo much Expedition and Courage cruſhed theſe Attempts, that they became abortive: for in the year 1088. he beſieges his Uncle <hi>Odo</hi> in this Fortreſs, and preſſes upon him with ſo much Vigor and Animoſity, that he forces him to ſurrender to diſcretion, but though he took not away his Life, he did that of his Liberty, and ſent him Priſoner to <hi>Tunbridge-caſtle,</hi> not under the Notion of Biſhop of <hi>Bajeux;</hi> for that would have infringed and invaded the Franchiſes of the Church, but under that of the Earl of <hi>Kent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this there was by the mediation and umpirage of <hi>Robert Fitz Hamon,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> a Compoſition made between <hi>William Rufus</hi> and <hi>Gundulphus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> the Reſult of which was this: The Prince was to confirm the Mannor of <hi>Hedenham</hi> to this Sea, and the Biſhop, to ballance this Conceſſion with ſomething which had the Face of Retribution, was to expend ſixty pound, in ſome additions to the Caſtle, and accordingly erected the great ſquare Tower, a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel which hath been too hard for the Teeth of Time, and by the vaſtneſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant remaining Skeleton, witneſſes the ſtrength of it to Poſterity, when it was in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103337:151"/>its primitive Grandeur, before the Rage of War, and the Fury of Elements threw it into this wild Diſorder and Confuſion; yet it is even in this ſhattered Condition, a better Alphabet to the Memory of the Biſhop its firſt Founder, then his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument or Repoſitory, for that lies entered in forgotten and neglected Ruines, but this ſtill preſerves his Name, and is called <hi>Gundulphus's</hi> Tower.</p>
                  <p>And being thus improved and fortified, with theſe new Acceſſions, it is not to be wondered at, that this Piece, was of that ſignal Eſtimate, in elder Times, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, by the Advice of his Councel, in the year 1126, granted the Cuſtody of this Caſtle, and the Office of Caſtellan, annexed to it, to <hi>William</hi> the then preſent Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and his Succeſſors, with free liberty to erect a Tower, that is another Fortreſſe, equivalent or Correſpondent to <hi>Gundulphs</hi> Tower, which before was erected for the Defence of this City and Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>In Times ſucceeding to theſe, that is, in the year 1215, <hi>William de Albineto</hi> or <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biniaco,</hi> in the Latine of thoſe Times, and written <hi>D' Albinet,</hi> in the Uſage of ours, was Governour of this Fortreſſe, for the factious party of the mutinous Barons, who were then in actual Arms againſt King <hi>John,</hi> but this Prince inveſted it with a formal Leaguer, and after the bloody Debate of a three Moneths Siege, forces the above-mentioned <hi>D' Albinet</hi> to a Surrender, wherein though the Virtue of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, was conſiderable, yet it was ruinous to him, and the Event hath left us Faith enough to believe, that Strength without the Concurrence of a Loyal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which may ſupport it, is like an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Reed, which ordinarily runs into the Fingers, and wounds them which lean upon it.</p>
                  <p>In the year after this, the Nobility, then combined and in Arms againſt King <hi>John,</hi> finding that their Forces were much empaired and diminiſhed by ſeverall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuccesful Encounters with that Prince, and that they muſt be forced to reſign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to thoſe rigorous Conditions that he would impoſe upon them, called in <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Dolphin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who landing in the Iſle of <hi>Thanett,</hi> with a conſiderable Army, advanced to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and by the concurrent Aſſiſtance of the Barons, who had united their ſtrength with his, made ſuch a furious Onſet upon this Caſtle, that like a Tempeſt which bears down all before it, he carried it by Aſſault.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1264. broke out that fatal Conteſt between <hi>Simon Montfort</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the Foundation or Original of which was this. That Earl being the great Aſſertor of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty againſt the turbulent Eruptions of Forrainers, endeavoured to tear away thoſe Strangers, that being placed too near the Royal Throne, had obſtructed and forelaid all the Avenues and Paſſages both to the Heart and Eare of that Prince: and this diſmal claſhing (like the Colliſion of two Flints) was productive of ſo waſting and deſtructive a Fire, that it had like, not only to have conſumed the Crown and Scepter, but likewiſe to have caſt the whole Kingdome it ſelf into a heap of Flame and Ruines, ſome Sparks of which were dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hither. For this Earl about the Time above ſpecified begirt the City and Caſtle of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> with a powerful Army, and that he might multiply all Advantages to himſelf, which might inforce his Deſign, and intercept the Succour intended the Beſieged, he burned the Bridge, whoſe Frame was then made up of Wood, and deſtroyed a Fortreſs that was placed upon it, which was compounded of the ſame Materials, and having effected this, he preſſed ſo hard upon the Caſtle, that he not only pillaged the adjacent Church and Abby, but likewiſe ſubdued the outward Ward or Gate, and had certainly by an abſolute Conqueſt at chieved the whole, had not King <hi>Henry</hi> arrived moſt opportunely, and by a ſuccesful encounter wreſted both Earl <hi>Warren,</hi> who had ſo vigorouſly maintained it, and that likewiſe, from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of his Fury.</p>
                  <p>After this, I find little of Moment to have been acted at this place, only I find the Caſtle to have been depoſited in the Hands of ſeveral eminent Perſons, who were extracted from Families, whoſe Blood was of as noble a Tincture as any in this County, and theſe held it under the Notion of <hi>Caſtellani</hi> or Guardians of it, an Office of a very important Concernment in elder Times. The firſt of which, who was entruſted with it, was <hi>William St. Clere,</hi> whoſe Ancient Seat, before his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor by the Match of the Coheir of <hi>Aldham</hi> removed to <hi>Ightam,</hi> was at <hi>Woodland</hi> in <hi>Kingſdown,</hi> and he died in the Tenure of this place, in the forty eighth year of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:103337:152"/>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the third. After him, I diſcover <hi>Robert de Hougham</hi> Lord of <hi>Hougham</hi> by <hi>Dover,</hi> to have had the Cuſtody of it, and he died inveſted in this Office, in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and in the next year after <hi>Robert de Septuans,</hi> from whom the <hi>Harfleets</hi> of <hi>Eaſt-Kent</hi> are deſcended, had the Care and Command of it. In Times of a nearer Approach to us, I find <hi>William Keriel</hi> or <hi>Criol,</hi> was entruſted with the Care and Government of it, and was poſſeſt of this Charge at his Death, in the firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth. After whoſe <hi>Exit,</hi> the Cuſtody was committed to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and he held it at his Deceaſe, which was in the eleventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth. But after this, it began ſo to languiſh away into its own Ruines, that it grew rather an Object of Pity, than of Envy, and reſted amongſt the Mannors of the Crown, untill King <hi>James,</hi> in the ſeventh year of his Reign, granted that goodly Skeleton of the Caſtle, which yet courts the Eye of the Beholder, to an Admiration of its former Strength, with all the Services annexed to it, to Sir <hi>Anthony Weldon,</hi> of <hi>Swanſcamp,</hi> whoſe Son and Heir <hi>Ralph Weldon</hi> of <hi>Swanſcamp</hi> Eſquire, is the inſtant Lord of the Fee.</p>
                  <p>There is much Land in this County held of this Caſtle, whoſe Tenure is perfect Caſtleguard: for upon the Day prefixed for the diſcharge of the quitt-Rent, relating to it, there is a Banner diſplaid and hung out (anciently it was over the Caſtle-Wall) and all thoſe who are Tenants to this Mannor, and are in Default by their non-Appearance, and do not diſcharge their Cuſtomary Duties, and Services, the Penaltie impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Neglect, is, that the Return of every Tide of the adjacent River which finds them Abſent, doubles their Service or quitt-Rent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bridge</hi> which is almoſt contiguous to the Root or Baſis, was anciently, when the Frame was of Timber, removed to a farther Diſtance, and croſſed the Stream, over againſt the Hoſpital of St <hi>Maries,</hi> at <hi>Stroude.</hi> But this was by <hi>Simon de Montfort</hi> when he beſieged <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> ruined by Fire, and although it was re-edified and repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not long after, yet ſome twenty years ſubſequent to this Misfortune, it was ſwept away by Ice, ſo that it appears the Elements entered into a Corrivalſhip or Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, which ſhould make the moſt ruinous Impreſſion, on this infortunate Structure.</p>
                  <p>But after this, that is, in the raign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, all thoſe above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Dyſaſters and Inconveniences, which might again have aſſaulted the <hi>Bridge,</hi> were for the future prevented; for Sir <hi>Robert Knolles,</hi> a Perſon who had improved, and enhaunſed his Fame, to the higheſt Degree of Eminence, by his glorious and ſucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Managery of the Engliſh Affairs, and Intereſt in <hi>France,</hi> ſeeking to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as uſefull to his Friends, that is, his Contrymen, as he was before conſiderable to his Enemies, maſtered the Courſe of the River, and ſomewhat nearer to the Caſtle as in a place more fit, both for the Soliditie, and faſtneſſe of the Soile, as likewiſe for the breaking of the impetuouſneſſe of the Current, erected the Bridge of Stone which is now viſible, fixed, and eſtabliſhed on one and twenty Arches, and by this Victory over the Elements, made his Triumphs more illuſtrious, than he had done before, by all the Conqueſts of his Adverſaries: for in theſe he only ſeemed to have out-gone all others, but in this, to have outdone himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Being thus fixed and Strengthned, there was a Statute enacted in the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, wherein there is Proviſion made for its future Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there being ſeveral parcells of Land, which are mentioned in that Act, tied and obliged for its continual Maintenance and Repair, whenſoever the Injuries of Time, or thoſe of the Elements, ſhould deface or impair it.</p>

                  <p>The Chappel or Chantry in old Records, ſtyled the Chantry of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Bridge, was founded in the year 1399, by <hi>Iohn de Cobham,</hi> and was dedicated to the holy Trinity, and was called at the firſt Inſtitution, <hi>All Souls</hi> Chappel, becauſe Prayers and other Orizons, were there to be offered up, for the Redemption and Health of all Chriſtian Souls, and likewiſe a Stipend or Exhibition was there ſetled, for the Support and Maintenance of three Prieſts, or Chaplains, particularly, to pray for the Souls of <hi>John de Cobham</hi> the Patron and Founder, Sir <hi>Robert Knolles,</hi> to whom the Bridge owed its primitive Eſtabliſhment, <hi>William Wangford</hi> and <hi>Eleanor</hi> his Wife, <hi>Iohn Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham</hi> and <hi>Alice</hi> his Wife, <hi>William Makenade,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Rickhil;</hi> and likewiſe for the Souls of ſome who were deceaſed before the Foundation of this Chappel, as

                  <p>The Priory was founded by <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> and dedicated to the Honor of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> and ſtored with Monks who were to live under the Rule of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> though afterwards, as Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> out of the Book of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> obſerves, they altered their Rule, and conformed themſelves to the Canon of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> but were reduced again to the primitive Inſtitution of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> in the year 1080, by <hi>Gundulphus</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> in which Deſign, he was aided and ſupported by <hi>Lanfranc</hi> the active Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> In Ages of an elder Inſcription, there were ſeveral Conteſts brake forth between the Monks of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and thoſe of this Covent; the firſt Strugling, to bring the Election of the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> into their Chapiter, which the laſt, Sticking cloſe to their own inherent Rights and Priviledges, endevoured to diſannul, and wholly to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his Election within the Precincts of their own Chapiter. Two Preſidents, which repreſent to Poſterity the whole State of this Controverſie, do occur in Record. The firſt appears in the year 1227, when after the Death of <hi>Benedict,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> elected to ſucceed him, <hi>Henry Sandford,</hi> a Man of exemplary Piety, ſo that he was inculpable for his Life, and of unfathomed Learning, ſo that he was in that Age, almoſt unparallelled for his Knowledge, which could not ſtave off the Monks of <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> to juſtle the Election, pretending that the paſtoral Staffe or Croſier of <hi>Rocheſter, de Jure,</hi> ought to have been brought to their Houſe, after the Deceaſe of the Biſhop, and that the Election was to have been made in their Chapiter. This occaſioned much Heat, for the Monks of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> vigorouſly aſſerted their own Choice, ſo that it was referred to the Deciſion of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, and he again put it over to the Umpirage of Delegates, who hearing the parties concerned, and poiſing the Allegations, produced by either ſide to ſuſtain the Juſtice of their own Cauſe; they by a finall Determination, declared the Right to reſide in the Monks of <hi>Rocheſter.</hi> But it ſeems this Fire, was only allayed, not extinguiſhed: for in the year 1238, it brake forth again, and the occaſion which gave Fuell to it, was this. The Monks of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> had elected <hi>Richard Wendover</hi> for their Biſhop, which ſo exaſperated and diſguſted the Monks of <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> that ſuſpecting their own Power, they, more to inforce and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply their Strength, and evacuate that Election, entituled Arch-biſhop <hi>Edmund</hi> to their Cauſe. But the Monks of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> diſclaiming, by a tame Remiſſeneſſe, either to foment or palliate their own undoing, appealed to <hi>Rome,</hi> where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the chargeable Commencement of a three years Sute, the Innocency and Juſtice of their Cauſe was recompenſed with the Triumph of the Day, upon which they returned home exalted with the Joy of their Succeſſe, and enacted in their Chapiter, that the annuall Feaſt of St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> on which Day they archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this ſignal Conqueſt, ſhould be doubly ſolemnized, both in their Church and in their Kitchin. But as they were ſucceſſefull in their rancounters with the Arch-biſhop, ſo they were very infortunate in that inteſtine Diſcord, which burſt out between them, and their own Biſhop <hi>Gilbert Glanville;</hi> who not only forcibly wrung from them their Goods, Ornaments, Writings, and other Muniments, but likewiſe deveſted them of a conſiderable Portion of their Lands, Poſſeſſions, and Priviledges, which forced them to appeal to <hi>Rome</hi> for Redreſſe; where they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled themſelves in a tedious Law-Sute, which engaged them to that vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, that they were conſtrained to coin the Silver of <hi>Paulinus</hi> Shrine into Money, to ſupport them in ſo expenſive and coſtly a Conteſt; and this much embaſed for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that Eſteem which the World formerly had entertained both of the Piety and Sanctitie of the Monks of this Cloiſter.</p>
                  <p>But theſe Conteſts did not ſo much prejudice or endamage this Cloiſter within, though accompanied with much Heat, as the Devaſtation occaſioned by the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fire without: for in the year 1130. when <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, with a great Convention of the Nobility and Biſhops was then preſent to ſolemnize the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Cathedral and Church, which was then newly finiſhed, a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:103337:153"/>ſuddain Flame broke out, whoſe Aſſaults upon this Covent, did much deface and empare the Glory of the Ancient Fabrick. And as if this impetuous Eruption had not been enough to diminiſh the Beauty of it, there was another Fire in the year 1177. which was about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, which exerciſed its Fury upon it, even to a total Depopulation of this Cloiſter; yet after all theſe Diſaſters, wherein it is diſputable, whether the Rage of men, or that of the Elements, were more deſtructive, by the Charitable Beneficence and Piety of that Age, it aroſe like a Phaenix, more Beautiful and vigorous, even out of its Embers and Aſhes, and continued in that condition, until the general Diſſolution, in the reign of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the eighth, and then that Prince having ſuppreſſed this Covent, and torn off their Revenue, upon their Ruines he eſtabliſhed a Dean and twelve Prebends, and endowed them for their future ſupport with that Demeaſne, which for the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of it, as namely, <hi>Wouldham, Halling, Snodland, Trotteſcliff, Denton, Longfeild, Boreſtal, Lidſing,</hi> and <hi>Stoke,</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Hoo,</hi> had been formerly annexed to the above-mentioned Cloiſter.</p>
                  <p>The Cathedral, with the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> united to it, were founded and eſtabliſhed by that pious Monarch <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> and the firſt Biſhop to whom was entruſted the Paſtoral Staffe or Croſier by <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> the Apoſtle of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> was <hi>Juſtus,</hi> the above-mentioned Prince, not only aſſenting unto this Election by his Preſence, but likewiſe contributing to the Support of the Perſon ſo choſen, and his Succeſſors by his liberal Beneficence. And indeed it is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in all thoſe Revolutions and Viciſſitudes, which have rolled and varied the Fate of things and Affairs, ſince the Seeds of Chriſtianity were ſown ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by the Hand of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in this Iſland, that the Chair of this Biſhoprick was ſtill fixed at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> whereas many others have in ſundry parts of the Nation ſuffered divers Tranſlations to other places then that where they at firſt were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; and the Reaſon is, becauſe by the Order of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, ſuch Biſhops as were before reſident in Towns and Villages, were forthwith to tranſplant their Seat into walled Cities and places of Defence, the more to oblige the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie, not only to repair thither for the Exerciſe of Devotion, but likewiſe to augment the Commerce and Bulk of thoſe Cities, by ſuch numerous Aſſemblies; but in this Command of his, <hi>Rocheſter</hi> could not be interreſſed or concerned, that was inveſted with a Wall, or ſomething equivalent to it long before the Age of the Conqueror. I ſhould now unfold a Catalogue of thoſe Biſhops that ſwayed the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier of this Sea, beginning with <hi>Juſtus,</hi> and concluding with <hi>John Warner</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Biſhop of this Dioceſs; but this is ſo obvious, both in <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and a late Manual, ſtyled <hi>The Help to Hiſtory,</hi> that I ſhall only hiſtorically Record the moſt eminent of them, and proceed. The firſt of whom I find to be <hi>Juſtus,</hi> who was tranſlated from this Sea, to that of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a Man whoſe Integrity of Life breathed out a noble perfume when he was living, and his Body, if we may credit the Fabulous and Superſtitious Legend of that Age, no leſs grateful an Odour when he was Dead, for 'tis reported that his Reliques being to be removed after their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment many years before, caſt forth (not the Stench or Steam of Putrefaction) but a Sent ſo odorous and fragrant, that it did not annoy, but exceedingly delight the Noſthrils of thoſe who were preſent; but indeed this might be poſſible without the Concurrence of a Miracle, if we conſider that thoſe Remains of his might be reſcued from the Fate of Corruption, by the Adjuncts or Circumſtances of Nard, Balm, Spicery, and Perfume; ſo that the Miracle ſeems to be impoſed by the Monks on the Laity of that Age, only to excite both their Devotion and Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paulinus,</hi> who was the third Biſhop, who ſucceeded him, converted <hi>Edwin</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>Edelburga</hi> his Queen, to Chriſtianity, and ſo juſtly meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Title of Apoſtle of that Province, for which he was recorded after his Death in the Regiſter of Saints, and had his Body ſo far ennobled, that it was wrapt up in a ſilver Shrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ithamar,</hi> who next ſucceeded him, had his Reliques likewiſe enſhrined in after Times by <hi>Gandulphus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> which was not only repaired, but very much adorned and beautified by Biſhop <hi>John</hi> his Succeſſor, becauſe (as the Book of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:103337:153"/>
                     <hi>Rocheſter</hi> intimates, he was redeemed, by touching his Reliques, <hi>ab acerrimo Oculo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Dolore,</hi> from ſome ſharp Diſtillation which did afflict his Eye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arnoſtus</hi> was preſent at <hi>Pinenden-heath,</hi> at the great Debate touching ſome Lands, which were unjuſtly raviſhed away from the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gundulphus</hi> his Succeſſor erected the white Tower in <hi>Rocheſter-caſtle:</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he at his firſt Inſtalment, found but ſix Canons in the Covent of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> he ſo liberally endowed it, that he left it repleniſhed with threeſcore Monks of the Order and Rule of St. <hi>Benedict.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tobias,</hi> whom I ſhould have mentioned after <hi>Ithamar,</hi> was (as <hi>Harp feild</hi> out of the <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter</hi>) a man very dextrous and skilful in the Tongues, and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Magazine of all other Learning both Divine and Humane beſide.</p>

                     <hi>Walter de Merton,</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> did not only found the Colledge of <hi>Merton</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> but likewiſe laid the Foundation of an imperfect Colledge at <hi>Maldon</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which by his Death was left unfiniſhed. He died in the year 1277. and lies buried in his own Church at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> to which in his Life Time he had been a Munificent Benefactor. In Gratitude to whoſe Memory Sir <hi>Henry Savil,</hi> and the Fellows of <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge, erected a Magnificent Monument, in the year 1599. over his Aſhes, which though it be much empaired both by Age, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious Affronts of theſe impious Times; yet ſhall the Name of this great man be the beſt Steward to his own Duſt: and when his Sepulchre it ſelf ſhall lie enterred in its own deplored Rubbiſh, this ſhall ſtand unto it ſelf an everlaſting Tomb and Epitaph.</p>

                     <hi>Hamon de Heath</hi> was Confeſſor to <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and a liberal Benefactor to this Church; He built the Houſe at the Mannor of <hi>Halling,</hi> which in ſome Ancient Records is ſtyled his Pallace.</p>

                     <hi>Joannes de Scapeia,</hi> or <hi>John de Shepey</hi> was Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England</hi> three years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard Young</hi> was a principal Contributor to the Reparation of the Church at <hi>Frendsbury,</hi> and wholly glazed the Windows: where not long ſince his pourtracture was expoſed to the publick View; a good Index, not only to his Memory, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the Remembrance of ſo pious a Work.</p>

                     <hi>John Lowe</hi> was born in the County of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and was a man in the Eſtimate of <hi>Bale,</hi> who writ his Life, not only of ſignal Piety, but likewiſe an Exchequer of all manner of Learning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Fiſher</hi> was a man of vaſt Knowledge, which yet was Ruinous to him for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the Papal Supremacy, when it was inveſted in <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, by an Act of Parliament; he offered up his Life on a Scaffold, as a Sacrifice to that opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nicolas Ridley</hi> was a man of an inculpable Life, and of a wide Knowledge, who was ſo an irrefragable Aſſertor of the Proteſtant Religion, that he gave himſelf up at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to the Fury of Fire and Faggot for the Teſtimony of what he before had profeſſed: and hath by his exemplary Life and Death, taught the Adverſaries of Epiſcopacy this Leſſon, that it is poſſible that the Seed may be pure as well as the Soyl; that is, the perſons of the Men, as well as the Office, may be incorrupt.</p>

                     <hi>John Warner</hi> is the laſt, who brings up this Catalogue, in whom the inſtant Title of this Biſhoprick is reſident, a man worthy of better Dayes, yet fit for theſe; who for his vaſt Encouragement of Learning in the beſt of Times, and his pious Support of it in the worſt, cannot be mentioned without an Attribute.</p>
                  <p>There have in elder Times many Conteſts and Animoſities broke out between the Biſhops of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and <hi>Worceſter;</hi> and the Fuel which fomented and ſupplied this Fire of Contention, was, that both theſe Prelates pretended to the Support of the Croſier before the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in all Proceſſions, and other Acts of publick and ſignal Solemnity; but in Fine, the Croſier or Paſtoral Staff was fixed or ſetled in the Hand of the Prelate of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and hath been by Preſcription ever ſince united as a convicted and Inherent Priviledge to this Dioceſſe.</p>
                  <p>Before I wave my Diſcourſe concerning this Biſhoprick, I muſt inform the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that there are ſome peculiars which are annexed to the Deanries of <hi>Croydon</hi> and <hi>Shorham,</hi> and this hath entangled and engaged many in much Difficulty to trace out the laſt Wils and Teſtaments of thoſe who deceaſed within the Confines and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:103337:154"/>of theſe peculiars. To unravel therefore theſe Niceties for the future; I ſhall repreſent a juſt Scale of theſe excepted places, out of the original Records of the Church of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> themſelves, that thoſe which can find no ſatisfaction in the Regiſters of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or Records of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> may yet diſcover what they are in purſuit of, in that Office, wherein theſe are enrolled and filed. But before I unwind their Catalogue, I ſhall in brief wrap up what in former Times hath been delivered touching the Office of Rural Deans, by <hi>Duarenus</hi> and others, who have more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly dilated themſelves upon this Subject. This Officer was certainly brought into the Church to ſupply the place of thoſe whom Antiquity ſtyled the <hi>Chore-Epiſcopi,</hi> who were commonly Aſſiſtants to the Biſhop: For indeed where the Dioceſſe was of that vaſt Latitude and Extent, that the Managery of ſo great a Truſt was diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the Diſcharge of one ſingle Perſon, it was neceſſary that his Care ſhould be ſupported by the mutual Counſel and concurrent Advice of others, whoſe prudence might improve the Affairs of the Church: and upon the going out of the above-mentioned Office, as being obſolete and antiquated, this of the Rural Dean came in. And to him did the Biſhop entruſt an Inſpection into the Lives of the Clergy, and from him did receive an exact Account of Scandal in its whole Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and other vitious Exceſſes, which might by an impious Connivance have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more blackneſs to the Caſſock: He was likewiſe, by Delegation from the Biſhop, to take Cogniſance of all Errors and Deviations from that which in that Age was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Orthodox Doctrine, that neither the Foundation nor Superſtructure of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion might be aſſaulted. And laſtly, where the Dioceſſe was wide, and of a large Territory, it frequently hapned that the Probate and Adminiſtration of ſundry Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments in divers places, was committed to his Care and Sway; and he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe entruſted with a Seal, with the Name of the Biſhop, whoſe Office by Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he was to diſcharge, and not his own, inſculped upon it: which upon his Deceaſe, or relinquiſhing this Office, was to be ſurrendered up into the Hands of the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe for the Time being, that he might diſpoſe of it as he ſhould judge convenient. Thus much of the Rurall Dean: the Peculiars of which I before promiſed a Catalogue, are as follow:

                  <p>Having done with the Church, I ſhall now deſcend to thoſe Mannors which lie circumſcribed within the Precincts and Verge of this City. The firſt is <hi>Boreſtall,</hi> which, as <hi>Textus Roffenſis</hi> denotes and ſignifies unto us, was given to the Church and Monks of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> by <hi>Kenulfus</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and was, as the Records of that Church teſtifie, <hi>de Cibo eorum,</hi> to ſupport their Table with a conſtant ſupply of Diet, and reſted annexed to their Demeaſne, until the Fatality of the General Diſſolution raviſhed it away, and afterwards it was by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, when he eſtabliſhed a Dean and Chapiter upon the Ruines of this above-mentioned Priory, linked unto that Revenue, which he granted them for their future ſubſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is <hi>Great Delce,</hi> which had owners of that Sirname, as is evident by <hi>Teſta de Nevill,</hi> and other Records both of a publick and private Stamp; but, it appears, was not of any permanent continuance in this Name: for before the middle of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, it was gon from that, and united to the Inheritance of <hi>Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:103337:154"/>Geffrey de Haſpall,</hi> enjoyed it at his Death under the Notion of the fourth part of a Knights Fee, as appears by an Inquiſition, taken in the fifteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 25. The next Family in Succeſſion after this, which was entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Poſſeſſion (as is evident by the original Deeds, now in the Hands of <hi>Lea</hi>) was <hi>Molineux,</hi> derived from thoſe of <hi>Sefton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> but he remained ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a Space in the Inheritance, that like <hi>Cato</hi> in the <hi>Theater,</hi> he only ſtept into it, that he might go out again; for about the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, as appears by the teſtimony of an ancient Court-roll, <hi>Benedict de Fulſham,</hi> was inveſted in the Patrimony of it in the thirtieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 20. And from him, did it ſtreame down in the Channel of ſucceſſive Intereſt, to his Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant <hi>Richard Fulſham,</hi> who likewiſe was in the Enjoyment of it at his Deceaſe, which was in the fifth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, <hi>Rot Eſc. Num.</hi> 17. But after his <hi>Exit,</hi> I find no farther mention of any of this Family, to have been poſſeſt of this place; for, in the ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, <hi>Reginald Love,</hi> died ſeiſed of it, and tranſmitted it to his Succeſſor, who held it untill the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then the Revolution of Purchaſe, brought it to be the Demeaſne of <hi>William Venour,</hi> and it was found to be his Poſſeſſion at his Death, which was in the firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 24. But after his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Title was very unſetled and inconſtant; for within the Circle of ſome Moneths after, it was by Sale from this Name, rolled into the Tenure of <hi>Markham</hi> deſcended from the ancient Stem of the <hi>Markhams,</hi> of <hi>Nottingham-ſhire,</hi> where after a very tranſitory aboad, it was by the ſame Fatality, carried into the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Tate;</hi> who about the firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Richard Lea,</hi> Lord Maior of <hi>London,</hi> deſcended from an ancient Family of that Name, in the County of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and his Son was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the nineteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and held his Shrievalty at his new acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Mannor of <hi>Much Delce,</hi> and from him by an even thread of Deſcent, has the Title and Propriety been conducted down to <hi>Richard Lea</hi> Eſquire, who is the inſtant Proprietary of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Horſted</hi> borrows its Name from <hi>Horſa,</hi> Brother to <hi>Hengiſt</hi> the Founder of the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Kingdome</hi> here in <hi>Kent,</hi> who fell by the Sword of the Britons at <hi>Alresford,</hi> as an expiatory Sacrifice, to ballance the Loſſe of <hi>Cartigerne,</hi> Brother to <hi>Vortimer,</hi> General of the Confederate Britiſh Forces, who was offered up in that ſignal Encounter, as an <hi>Holocauſt</hi> to the Saxon Fury; and there is ſomething, which even at this Day, lies wrapt up in the Name, that induces us to believe, that <hi>Horſa</hi> after his ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, recieved the Rites of his Funeral at this place; and in our Grandfathers Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, there were the ſcattered Remains of diverſe huge Maſſie Stones, which Storms and other Impreſſions of Time, have now altogether demoliſhed: and theſe certainly were, in elder Times, compoſed into the Figure of a Monument, to ſhroud the Aſhes of this <hi>Horſa;</hi> as thoſe at <hi>Cits Cothouſe,</hi> above <hi>Alresford,</hi> were framed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Proportionate Mould, to ſecure the Duſt, or at leaſt to point out to Poſterity the Memory of <hi>Cartigern.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Mannor it ſelf, was enwraped in the Patrimony of the noble and ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Apulderfield. William de Apulderfield,</hi> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at <hi>Horſted,</hi> in the thirty eighth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth. In Times of a lower Deſcent, I diſcover it in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Warren;</hi> for <hi>John,</hi> Son of <hi>Edmund Warren,</hi> held it at his Death, which was in the twelfth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. After <hi>Warren</hi> had quitted the Inheritance, I find the <hi>Fulſhams</hi> by Purchaſe to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled to the Fee-ſimple of it; and <hi>Benedict de Fulſham,</hi> enjoyed in at his Deceaſe, which was in the thirtieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and paid relief for this and <hi>Much Delce,</hi> under the Notion of the fourth part of a Knights Fee, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of the above-ſaid Prince. After this Family was worn out, it had ſucceſſively the ſame Poſſeſſors with <hi>Much Delce,</hi> ſo that it came with that Mannor by Purchaſe from <hi>Tate,</hi> to Sir <hi>Richard Lea</hi> Knight; and from him is the Title by ſucceſſive Deſcent, tranſported to <hi>Rtchard Lea</hi> Eſquire, the preſent Poſſeſſor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Snodherſt</hi> is another Mannor which lies partly ſpread into <hi>Chetham,</hi> and partly into the Limits of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> was, as high as I can trace any Record, a Branch of that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:103337:155"/>Demeaſn, which fell under the Dominion of <hi>Badeleſmer,</hi> and though <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Lord <hi>Bade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>leſmer,</hi> had by his perfidious Diſloyalty, forfeited it in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond; yet was it in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, reſtored to his Son <hi>Bartholomew Badeleſmer,</hi> who in the twelfth year of that Prince, dyed without Iſſue, and left it to his Brother <hi>Giles Badeleſmer,</hi> who likewiſe deceaſing without Iſſue; Sir <hi>John Tiptoft,</hi> in Right of <hi>Margery</hi> his Wife, one of his Siſters and Coheirs, entered upon the Inheritance of it: but, before the twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, had alienated it to <hi>Benedict de Fulſham,</hi> for he in that year, as appears by the Book of <hi>Aid,</hi> paid reſpective relief for it, at the making the Black Prince Knight, After <hi>Fulſhams</hi> were extinguiſhed at this place, it had the Fate to own the Juriſdiction and Intereſt of thoſe, who were the Succeſſive Proprietaries of <hi>Much Delce,</hi> ſo that it is now knit to the preſent Inheritance of <hi>Richard Lea</hi> Eſquire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Little Delce</hi> is the laſt Mannor which is circumſcribed within the Precincts of this City. It was, in Ages of a very high Calculation, the Poſſeſſion of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, illuſtrious, and ancient Family of <hi>Sherington,</hi> written in old Deeds, Pipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolls, and other Evidences, <hi>Serington,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Scherington,</hi> but moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Sherington:</hi> whoſe original and principal Seat, was at <hi>Sherington-hall</hi> at <hi>Cranworth</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> though they had other Mannors, which bore their Name, which anciently were folded up in their Demeaſne, as namely <hi>Sherington</hi> in the County of <hi>Buckingham, Sherington</hi> in <hi>Suſſex, Sherington</hi> in the County of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and <hi>Sherington</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> yet, as I take it, in their Poſſeſſion. But to proceed, <hi>Odo de Serington,</hi> or <hi>Sherington,</hi> for the Names are <hi>Synonyma</hi> or coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, held this Mannor in the thirty firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, and was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Cathedral of <hi>Rocheſter;</hi> and when <hi>Robert Glover Somerſet Herald,</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his <hi>Miſcellany</hi> of Church-notes, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there were ſome Reliques of his Monument, offered up to the Survey of a curious and Inquiſitive Eye, which now the Sacrilegious Barbarity of impious Mechanicks, and the injurious Hand of Time together, have wholly diſmantled. After <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> was worn out, I find a Family, called <hi>Pugeis,</hi> inveſted in the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and there is mention in the ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, in <hi>Kirkbies Inqueſt</hi> (a Book kept in the Exchequet,) of one <hi>Richard Pugeis</hi> who then held it: but before the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, this Family had deſerted the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and tranſmitted his Concernment in it by Sale to <hi>Richard Charles,</hi> and he enjoyed it at his Deceaſe, which was in the fifth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num</hi> 92. And ſo did <hi>Nicholas Charles</hi> his Succeſſor, in the eleventh year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 16. And <hi>Robert</hi> was his Son and Heir, who dying without Iſſue, it was united to the Demeaſne of <hi>Richard Ormes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> in right of <hi>Joan,</hi> Siſter and Heir of the above-mentioned <hi>Robert;</hi> and he in the third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, alienated it to <hi>Henry Perey,</hi> Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland;</hi> and he not long after, paſſed it away to <hi>Rickhull,</hi> in which Family it reſted, untill the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then it was by Deed conveyed from <hi>William Rickhull</hi> Eſquire, to <hi>Thomas Glover,</hi> and <hi>Henry Hunt,</hi> who had then the Cuſtody or Guardianſhip of <hi>Rocheſter-Bridge,</hi> and to the ſucceſſive Wardens of it, towards the Preſervation and Reparation of its Fabrick for ever; ſo that at this inſtant, it is parcel of that Revenue, which reſcues this noble Structure from Decay and Ruin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Naſhenden</hi> next offers it ſelf up to our Remembrance. In the raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, I find it entituled to the Poſſeſſion of a Family called <hi>Aſpall,</hi> and in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>John Aſpall,</hi> paid reſpective Aid, at making the Black Prince Knight. But before the latter end of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, this Family, had ſurrendred the Inheritance of this place to <hi>Peckham:</hi> the laſt of which Name, which held it, was <hi>John Peckham,</hi> who (as the Records of <hi>Rocheſter-Bridge</hi> informs me) in the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, made it part of that Demeaſn by Sale, which was to ſupport, with its Income, the Fabrick of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> Bridge, in whoſe Revenue, you may at this inſtant, ſtill find it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident.</p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:103337:155"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rolvenden</hi> gives Name to the Hundred wherein it is placed, and is reſolved into ſeveral places of eminent Conſideration, which do not only call for a Survey, but even exact it: The firſt is <hi>Halden,</hi> called in Records the Mannor of <hi>Lambin, alias Halden,</hi> and the Reaſon of this Denomination is, becauſe it aſſumed the firſt part of this Name from <hi>Lambinus de Langham,</hi> who held it under the Diſtribution of a whole Knights Fee (as the Book called <hi>Teſta de Nevill</hi> demonſtrates) in the twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, at the Marriage of <hi>Iſabell</hi> that Prince's Siſter, at which Time he accounted ſo for it: After this Family was departed from the poſſeſſion of this place, which was about the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, the <hi>Haldens</hi> were by purchaſe ſetled in the Poſſeſſion, and <hi>William de Halden</hi> Son of <hi>John de Halden,</hi> died ſeiſed of it, in the fiftieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 45. and left it to his Son <hi>John Halden,</hi> but he expiring, about the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, in <hi>Joan</hi> his Daughter and Heir, ſhe by matching with <hi>John Guldeford</hi> Eſquire, made it parcel of his Patrimony, and from him it devolved by Deſcent to Sir <hi>Richard Guldeford,</hi> who was Knighted at <hi>Milford-haven</hi> by <hi>H.</hi> the ſeventh, and was afterwards one of the Privy Counſel to that Prince. In the eighth year of his reign, he with Courage and Prudence oppoſed <hi>James</hi> Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> and his <hi>Corniſh</hi> Squadrons, in that Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they made upon this County, and in the Battle waged near <hi>Deptford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> between King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and thoſe Rebels, repreſented ſuch ſignal Teſtimonies of perſonal Magnanimity, that he was by that Prince made a Banne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret at <hi>Black-heath.</hi> His Son <hi>Henry Guldeford</hi> Eſquire, in the firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, went into <hi>Spain,</hi> and engaged himſelf under <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Aragon,</hi> in their Wars commenced againſt the <hi>Moores,</hi> and demeaned himſelf with that Fidelity and exemplary Reſolution in all Conflicts entertained with thoſe barbarous Infidels, that upon the Reduction of the Province of <hi>Granada,</hi> the above-mentioned Prince, for his ſignal Service performed in his and the Chriſtian Quarrel, added to his Paternal Coat as an Augmentation, <hi>A Pomgranet ſlipped upon a Canton,</hi> being the Arms of that regained Province, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe dignified him with the Order of Knighthood. In the fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, he was again inveſted with the aboveſaid Order by that Prince, and in the fifth of his reign, he commanded one of the Royal Navy called the Regent, in which Ship he acted Things worth the future Remembrance in that Sea-fight, which was waged between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> near <hi>Brittain,</hi> and in the ſame year (as appears by the Original Patent bearing Date the twenty eighth of <hi>May</hi>) he was made Standard-bearer of <hi>England,</hi> and carried it at the Siege of <hi>Terwin:</hi> His Son Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Guldeford,</hi> in the fifteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, received the Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, for his Service at <hi>Tourney,</hi> and was Captain of the Horſe under the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> at the ſecond Siege of <hi>Terwin,</hi> which was in the fifteenth year of that Prince, and not long after reduced <hi>Boghan-caſtle,</hi> taking the Advantage of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which had ſealed up the Marſhes, which environed it, and made it almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible in a Froſt. In fine, this worthy Souldier and Patriot dying without Iſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, left this Mannor of <hi>Halden</hi> to be enjoyed by <hi>Jane</hi> his Sole Inheritrix, matched to <hi>John Dudley</hi> Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and he having unhappily engaged himſelf in that ruinous Deſign, which was to deveſt Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of the Royal Diadem, and place it on the Head of the Lady <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> wedded to his Son <hi>Guilford Dudley,</hi> was in the firſt year of that Queen, for that inſolent Attempt, which proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful, attainted and beheaded, his Eſtate here being confiſcated to the Crown, the Mannor was given by that Princeſs to Sir <hi>John Baker,</hi> her Attorney General, Anceſtor to Sir <hi>John Baker</hi> Knight and Baronet, who at this Inſtant enjoyes the Mannor, but the Demeaſne of it was granted to Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> whoſe Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> not many years ſince conveyed it to Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe Grand-child <hi>Robert Smith</hi> Eſquire, lately died poſſeſt of it.</p>
                  <p>There are twelve <hi>Denns</hi> which hold of this Mannor of <hi>Lambin, aliàs Halden,</hi> and at the Court-day elect twelve Officers, called <hi>Beadles,</hi> to collect the Quit-rents, which relate to it: The Names of them here enſue, <hi>Midſell</hi> in <hi>Rolvenden, Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenden</hi> in <hi>Rolvenden, Ramſden</hi> in <hi>Benenden, Weſt Biſhoppenden</hi> in <hi>Benenden, Folkinden</hi> in <hi>Benenden</hi> and <hi>Sandherſt, Holnherſt</hi> in <hi>Benenden, Elderherſt</hi> in <hi>Halden</hi> and <hi>Tenterden,

In Times which were immediatly ſubſequent to the departure of this Family from this place, that is, in the Government of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, I find by an Ancient Court-roll, the <hi>Moores</hi> to have been poſſeſt of it, and kept it in their Inheritance, until the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was conveyed to <hi>Gibbons</hi> of <hi>Rolven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> from which Family, about the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as appears by the Court-rols, now in the Hands of my Learned Friend Mr. <hi>Kilbourn,</hi> it went away to <hi>Hay</hi> or <hi>Hays</hi> of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and in this Name it remained until that Time which bordered upon our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was alienated to <hi>Everden</hi> or <hi>Everinden,</hi> deſcended from the <hi>Everindens</hi> of <hi>Everinden-houſe</hi> in <hi>Biddenden,</hi> where they are recorded by the private Deeds of that place, to have been reſident many Hundred years, until in the ſecond year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> it was paſſed away by Sale to <hi>John Mils,</hi> Anceſtor to the preſent Proprietary. But to proceed, the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Family at this place, was but brief and tranſitory; for not many years ſince, it went away by Sale from this Name to <hi>Muns,</hi> where the Inheritance ſtill continues.</p>

                     <hi>Freſingham</hi> ſometimes written <hi>Ferſingham,</hi> and vulgarly called <hi>Frenſham,</hi> is the laſt place of Account in <hi>Rolvenden.</hi> It had in the twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, as appears by <hi>Teſta de Nevill,</hi> a Family of that Name which was its Poſſeſſor; for <hi>John de Freſingham</hi> or <hi>Ferſingham</hi> held it then, and paid for it after the Rate of the fourth part of a Knights Fee, at the Marriage of <hi>Iſabell</hi> that Prince's Siſter. And in this Family did it remain until the latter part of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and then the Viciſſitude of Purchaſe brought it to be the Demeaſne of <hi>Norwood,</hi> and in this Name was it reſident, until the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and then, as appears by the old Rols of this Mannor, it was conveyed to <hi>Guldeford,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Guldeford,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Deceaſe, gave it to his ſecond Son Sir <hi>George Guldeford,</hi> from whom it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to his Grand-child Sir <hi>Edward Guldford,</hi> who about the beginning of King <hi>James</hi> paſſed it away to Mr. <hi>Fowle,</hi> who bequeathed it to his ſecond Son Mr. ...... <hi>Fowle,</hi> who ſold it to Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> Knight and Baronet, Grand-father to Sir <hi>Edward Hales,</hi> who poſſeſſes the inſtant Signory and Fee-ſimple of it.</p>

                     <hi>Old Romney</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Langport,</hi> is eminent for two or three places which lie within the Confines of it, which are both of Spiritual and Secular Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The firſt is <hi>Agne-court</hi> and <hi>Orgarſwike,</hi> not diſtant by any conſiderable Difference of ſpace from this Town, and which was once a Pariſh entirely in it ſelf, until, it is probable, the unhealthful Situation made the Inhabitants vary their Station and diſlodge: which were both given by <hi>Offa</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> in the year ſeven hundred eighty and one, to the Prior and Monks of <hi>Chriſt-church, ad Paſcua Porcorum,</hi> ſay the Records of that Covent, that is, for the feeding or grazing of their Hoggs. And it is poſſible that the Foundation of this Grant was the profuſe Effuſion, not only of Chriſtian, but of Innocent Blood, which had been ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally waſted, to be ſubſervient and miniſterial to the ambitious Intereſts and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the above-mentioned Prince, and though peradventure he had endeavored to waſh off thoſe Crimſon Stains which ſtuck upon his Hands, beſmeared with the Blood of <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles,</hi> and others, with penitential Pears; yet he deemed that an inſufficient Expiation to aſſoil himſelf from his contracted Guilt, unleſſe he made his Compunction more viſible and conſpicuous, by a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Manifeſtation both of his Piety and Charity together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bere</hi> or <hi>Berry-court</hi> in <hi>Old Romney</hi> (for it carried the firſt Appellation in very Old Evidences) is a Mannot which hath contracted a Reputation from thoſe large Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and other Services which appertain unto it, rather then from the Dimenſion and extent of its Revenue, which is but narrow and circumſcribed; <hi>Nicholas de Bere</hi> held it, in the twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, as appears by an old Court-roll, which hath an Aſpect upon that Time. He was Son of <hi>Richard de Bere,</hi> who was one of the <hi>Recognitores Magnae Aſſiſae</hi> (an Office of a wide circumference of Truſt in that Age) in the ſecond year of King <hi>John,</hi> in the great Controverſie which was ſtarted between <hi>Richard de Garwinton,</hi> and <hi>Theobald de Twitham,</hi> concerning Land at <hi>Ilding</hi> in <hi>Kingſton.</hi> In the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, I find that <hi>Robert Forneaux, Robert Atwood,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Tutwiſe</hi> had ſome Intereſt in <hi>Berry-court,</hi> and paid reſpective <hi>Aide</hi> for it, as the Book of <hi>Aide</hi> informs me, at making the Black Prince Knight: But before the beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, I find the Title wholly concentered in <hi>Belknap;</hi> for Sir <hi>Robert Belknap</hi> the Judge, did not only hold it in the firſt year, but likewiſe in the tenth of that Prince: at what Time being attainted and baniſhed, by the Malevolent Concurrence of ſome ambitious Lords, whoſe Influence like a Confederacy of Malignant Aſpects in the Stars, combined to Ruine him, this by Eſcheat was inveſted in the Crown, and was by Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion (as appears by the Original Patent) conveyed in the thirteenth of <hi>Richard</hi> the third; to <hi>John Brockman.</hi> In Times of a lower ſtep, that is, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, I find it in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>John Newland:</hi> but whether by Purchaſe from <hi>Brockman</hi> or not, for want of Intelligence, I cannot diſcover. And in this Family the Propriety continued, until the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then it was conveyed to Sir <hi>George Perkins,</hi> from whom almoſt in our Memory the ſame Mutation brought it to confeſs the inſtant poſſeſſion of Mr. ...... <hi>Aldridge</hi> of <hi>Tilers</hi> near <hi>Reding.</hi>

                     <hi>Barbedinden</hi> is another eminent Mannor within the Boundaries of this Pariſh, which had in Ages of a more Ancient Inſcription Proprietaries of the ſame Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; <hi>William de Barbodinden</hi> held it at his Death, which was in the ninth of

After this Family was extinguiſhed, <hi>Robert Belknap</hi> the Judge ſucceeded in the Poſſeſſion of it: and I do not find, that, though the Crown upon his Attaint, ſeiſed upon much of his Eſtate, that ever his Intereſt here was raviſhed away from him; for he was in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this place at his Death, which was in the ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and diſpoſed it by Will, to his Son <hi>John Belknap,</hi> who about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, alienates it to <hi>Engham:</hi> amongſt whoſe Demeaſne, the Propriety of this Mannor had not many years dwelt, but the Title was by Sale ſupplanted, and caſt into the Poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>Matthew Brown</hi> Knight, and his Son <hi>Thomas Brown</hi> Eſquire, in the laſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth; paſſed it away by Sale to <hi>Anthony Lovelace</hi> Eſquire, Anceſtor to <hi>Richard Lovelace,</hi> who ſome few years ſince, alienated his entire Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it, to the late Poſſeſſor Mr. <hi>Richard Hulſe,</hi> deſcended from the ancient Family of <hi>Hulſe,</hi> of the <hi>Borough</hi> of <hi>Hulſe,</hi> lying within <hi>Namptwich,</hi> in the County of <hi>Cheſter.</hi>

It was granted to the Church, in the year 1096, by one <hi>Halden,</hi> who for Grandeur and opulency, was reckoned one of the Princes of <hi>England.</hi> The Value and extent of it, are more particularly ſet forth, in the Records of the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the Conquerour's Time, and they ſpeak thus: <hi>In Limwarlaed in Hundred. de Hede, habet Hugo de Montfort de Terra Mouachorum</hi> I <hi>Manerium Saltwode de Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epiſcopo, &amp; Comes Godwinus tenuit illud, &amp; tunc ſe defendebat pro</hi> VII <hi>Sullings</hi> (That was <hi>Godwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> who by a poſſeſſory right, held many Towns along this Coaſt) <hi>&amp; nunc ſunt</hi> V. <hi>&amp; tamen non Scottent, niſi pro</hi> III. <hi>Et in Burgo de Hede ſunt</hi> CC. <hi>&amp;</hi> XXV. <hi>Burgenſes, qui pertinent huic Manerio, de quibus non habet Hugo niſi</hi> III. <hi>Forisfacta</hi> (for it lies in the Franchiſe of the five Ports, and the King was to have their Serice <hi>&amp; eſt appretiatum</hi> XXVIII. <abbr>lb.</abbr>

               <p>There is an old vaſt Manſion Houſe of Stone, at <hi>Brochull</hi> in this Pariſh, on the ſide of a Steep Hill, which was the Seat and ancient Reſidence of a Family as eminent for Antiquity, as any in this Track, and extracted their Sirname from hence, and were called <hi>Brochull,</hi> who flouriſhed here in Knights Degree, and in ſome Parliaments in the Time of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, and <hi>Edw.</hi> the fourth, ſate there as Knights of the Shire. <hi>Margaret</hi> the Wife of <hi>William,</hi> builded, or cauſed to be built, an Iſle on the Northſide the Pariſh Church.

                  <hi>Darbies-court</hi> in this Pariſh gave Seat and Sirname to a Family, which was known to the World by no other Denomination, and certainly was a Family of generous Account in this Track; for in very ancient Regiſters and Rols of <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Gentry; I find this Coat to be borne by this Name, <hi>videlicet, Partie per Cheveron embattelled, Or, and Azure, three Eagles counterchanged:</hi> And of this Family was <hi>John Darby</hi> Eſquire, who was Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1445. and built the South-Iſle of St. <hi>Dionis Back-church</hi> near <hi>Lime-ſtreet,</hi> where the Windows repreſent to our View the above-mentioned Coat, as the beſt Index to the Memory of ſo munificent a Benefactor: But to proceed; Before the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of this Manſion was by Sale conveyed from <hi>Darby</hi> to <hi>St. Leger,</hi> where its aboad was of as brief a continuance; for the Male-line failing in <hi>Thomas St. Leger</hi> Eſquire, who bought it, by <hi>Joan</hi> his Daughter and Co-heir wedded to <hi>Henry Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> Eſquire, it came over to be the Inheritance of that Family, and in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue was conſtantly fixed, until the Age and Remembrance of our Grand-fathers, and then it was alienated to Sir <hi>Michael Sonds</hi> of <hi>Eaſtry,</hi> from whom by hereditary Right it devolved to Sir <hi>Richard Sonds</hi> of <hi>Throuley,</hi> who in his Life-time paſſed it

The Demeaſne which rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, was divided between the two noble Families of <hi>Crioll</hi> and <hi>Auberville: Bertram de Crioll,</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the twenty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and is written in the Pipe-roll of that year, of <hi>Weſtenhanger,</hi> a Name co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident with the other.

And left it to <hi>Joan</hi> his Daughter, married to Sir <hi>Richard de Rokeſley,</hi> who upon the Deceaſe of her only Brother <hi>John de Crioll,</hi> without Iſſue, became his Sole Heir. This Sir <hi>Richard de Rokeſley,</hi> was one of thoſe eminent <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Gentlemen, that accompanied King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for his ſignal Service performed at the Siege of <hi>Carlaverock,</hi> was made a Banneret by that Prince:

                  <hi>Stapleherſt</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Twyford,</hi> was as appears by Ancient Deeds and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, as to ſome part of it, folded up in the large Patrimony of <hi>Fremingham,</hi> whoſe capital Reſidence was at <hi>Fremingham</hi> or <hi>Farningham,</hi> where I have treated more largely of them: but when the Male-line of this Family determined in <hi>John de Fremingham, Joan</hi> his only Siſter matched to <hi>John Iſley</hi> Eſquire, Son of <hi>Iſley</hi> was found to be his Heir, in the ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and in her Right <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Iſley</hi> Son and Heir of this <hi>John,</hi> entered upon it, and from him the Land here, by a ſucceſſive Thread of Deſcent, was wafted down to the Noble, but infortunate Sir <hi>Henry Iſley,</hi> of whom more preſently: but another parcel of this Mannor did acknowledge the Signory of <hi>Pimpe</hi> of <hi>Nettleſted,</hi> and <hi>William Pimpe</hi> died poſſeſt of it, in the year of our Lord 1375. as part of his Knights Fee called <hi>Pimps:</hi> and in his Line did the Title flow conſtantly along, until it devolved to <hi>Reginald Pimpe</hi> Eſquire, who about the twelfth year of. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, demiſed it by private Deed to <hi>John Iſley</hi> Eſquire, from whom it came down to his Grand-child Sir <hi>Henry Iſley,</hi> who being entangled too fatally in the ruinous Deſign of Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat,</hi> was in

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:103337:161"/>now but diſmantled Ruines. The Tradition of the Country is, that, that Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley which interpoſes between that Hill, which aſcends up to <hi>Northfleet,</hi> and that which winds up to <hi>Swanſcamp,</hi> was once covered with Water, and being locked in on each ſide with Hills, made a ſecure Road for Shipping, which invited the Dane to make it a Winter-Station for his Navy: and the ſame Report will tell you likewiſe, of Anchors which have been digged up about the utmoſt Verge of that Merſh, which is contiguous to the <hi>Thames,</hi> and certainly if we conſider the Poſition of this Valley, which is nothing but a Chain of <hi>Merſhland,</hi> interlaced with a Stream called <hi>Ebbs fleet,</hi> which ſwells and ſinks with the Flux and Reflux of the adjacent River, and the Dimenſion of their Ships, then at that Time in uſe, which were not of any extraordinary Bulk, this Tradition is not improbable.</p>
               <p>Near this place, <hi>Stigand</hi> the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Egelſine</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> aſſembled the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Men into an Army, pretending it was better to dye like Men in aſſerting and vindicating their Native Liberties, with. Swords in their Hands, then like Slaves to proſtitute themſelves to the Inſolence of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, by a cheap and tame Submiſſion with Halters about their Necks: which had ſo great an Influence and Impreſſion upon their Spirits, that they reſolved their Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes and themſelves ſhould find one Tomb together, rather then they would give up both, to the Sword and Will of an imperious Victor; and indeed ſoon after they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged their Stratagems with that Succeſſe, that <hi>William</hi> Sirnamed the Conquerour, advancing with his <hi>Normans</hi> into <hi>Kent,</hi> to reduce <hi>Dover-Caſtle,</hi> which was then made good againſt him, he and his Army dropped into thoſe Ambuſhes, which the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Inhabitants had ſtrewed for him, where he had indiſputably periſhed, had he not by Charter fortified and confirmed thoſe Immunities, they then contended and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for, and which remain unviolated either by any forrain or domeſtick Eruption even untill this Day.</p>
               <p>The Mannor of <hi>Swanſcamp</hi> it ſelf, was, as farre as Record can guide us to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Inheritance of the <hi>Montchenſies,</hi> called in the Latine, Repertory <hi>de Monte-Caniſio:</hi> and <hi>Hubert de Montchenſey</hi> (as appears by <hi>Doomſ-day</hi> Book) was the firſt of that Name of any Eminence, who was Lord of the Fee; and after him his Son <hi>William de Montchenſey,</hi> by paternal Right held it, and ſo dyed in Poſſeſſion of it, in the year 1287; from whom it deſcended to <hi>Dionis</hi> his Daughter and Heir, and in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to her, to her Husband, <hi>Hugh de Vere,</hi> who became by this Addition of Eſtate, thus accruing, Baron of <hi>Swanſcamp,</hi> and ſat, under that Notion, in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was ſummoned in the firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond: but he dying without Iſſue, <hi>William de Valence</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> claimed it in Right of his Wife, Daughter and Heir to <hi>John de Montchenſey,</hi> ſecond Brother to <hi>William de Montchenſey</hi> who was Father in Law to <hi>Hugh de Vere</hi> above-mentioned; from whom it deſcended to his Son <hi>Aymer de Valence,</hi> who dying without Iſſue, in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third, <hi>Iſabell</hi> his Siſter matched to <hi>Lawrence de Haſtings,</hi> became his Heir, who in her Right was Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and Baron of <hi>Swanſcamp;</hi> and left it to his Grandchild <hi>John de Haſtings,</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> who dying without Iſſue, in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond; in the fifteenth year of that Prince, <hi>Reginald Grey,</hi> and <hi>Richard Talbot</hi> in reſpect of Marriage, were found to be his Heirs, and upon the Partition of the Eſtate, this was united to the Demeaſne of <hi>Talbot,</hi> in which Family, after it had reſted untill the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, it was conveyed to Sir <hi>Thomas Brown</hi> of <hi>Bechworth</hi> Caſtle, whoſe Son Sir <hi>William Brown,</hi> in the twelfth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, ſurrendered them into the hands of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, for the uſe of his Mother <hi>Cicely</hi> Dutcheſſe Dowager of <hi>York,</hi> upon whoſe Deceaſe it returned to the Crown, and lay there untill the firſt year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then it was granted to <hi>Ralph Weldon</hi> Esq; great Grand-father to Colonel <hi>Ralph Weldon</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Lord of the Fee.</p>

                  <hi>Staple</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Eaſtry,</hi> hath two places memorable: Firſt, <hi>Crixall</hi> which was Anciently written <hi>Crickleaddſhall,</hi> when in Ages of a higher Aſcent it confeſſed the Family of <hi>Brockhull</hi> for its Owners, which were Lords of it but until the twenty eighth of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and then it was ſetled upon a Daughter: but whether ſhe brought it or not by Marriage to <hi>Wadham,</hi> which Family I find about the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, to have been poſſeſt of it, I cannot diſcover; and where the Light of Record is dim, I muſt acquieſce in ſilence. <hi>William Wadhaem,</hi> as I trace out by an old Pedigree of <hi>Fogg,</hi> lived in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, under the Scepter of which Princes he managed the Office of Juſtice of the Peace for the County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and left his Eſtate here to his Son and Heir Sir <hi>Nicholas Wadham,</hi> who determined in a Daughter and Heir, match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Sir <hi>William Fogg,</hi> by which Alliance this Mannor came to be ingrafted into the Inheritance of that Family, and reſted there until the firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was paſſed away by Sale from Sir <hi>John Fogg</hi> Knight, to <hi>Ralph Baniſter.</hi> In Times of a lower Deſcent, that is, about the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> I find it by Court-rols poſſeſt by <hi>Tucker,</hi> who about the latter end of that Princeſs alienated his Concernment in it to <hi>Smith,</hi> who in our Fathers Remembrance tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted the Title by Sale into Doctour <hi>Fotherbie</hi> Dean of <hi>Cantorbury,</hi> whoſe Son Mr. <hi>Charles Fotherbie</hi> continues now Proprietary of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Grove-place</hi> offers it ſelf up to our Notice, as being the Habitation of a Knightly Family, called <hi>Grove,</hi> who in old Deeds are ſometimes written, at-<hi>Grove,</hi> and ſealed, as appears by the <hi>Labells</hi>-affixed to their Evidences, with <hi>three Eſcollops upon a Cheveron:</hi> In the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, I find it devolved by Deſcent to Sir <hi>John Grove,</hi> who was a great Benefactor to the Church of St. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Sandwich,</hi> where he lies buried with the Arms above-mentioned upon his Shield: but not long after, this Family determined in a Daughter and Heir, who linked this Seat to the Inheritance of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who about the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed it to <hi>Quilter,</hi> in which Name it was reſident, until the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was paſſed away to <hi>Linch,</hi> and hath remained ever ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into the Revenue of that Family: ſo that at preſent it is come down to Mr. <hi>John Linch,</hi> a Noble Confeſſor for the Intereſt of the Church, and Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>There is a Family in this Pariſh called <hi>Omer,</hi> which as appears by old Court-rols, Tombs, Deeds, and other Evidences, have been conſtantly reſident almoſt four Hundred years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seaſalter</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Whitſtaple,</hi> did belong to the Priory of <hi>Chriſt-church:</hi> but by whom it was given, the Records of that Covent are ſilent: only I find that it was part of that Revenue which ſupported their Diet and Table, and likewiſe I diſcover that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth, in the tenth year of his Papacy, by his Bull appropriated the Parſonage to the Priory above-mentioned, and likewiſe was granted for the better improving their Lively-hood and Subſiſtence. If you will ſee under what Notion it paſſed, in the twentieth year of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, <hi>Doomeſday</hi> Book will inform you, that it was valued upon the Terrier at two Carucats of Land, and upon the Appraiſment was rated at five pound. This Mannor upon the Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>In <hi>Sedingbourn</hi> Church there was a Monument of Sir <hi>Richard Lovelace,</hi> inlayed richly with Braſſe, who was an eminent Souldier in his Time, and Marſhal of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, with his Pourtraiture affixed in Braſs, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of Time, and the Impiety of Sacrilegious Mechanicks, have utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled and defaced.</p>

                  <hi>Selling</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Boughton,</hi> did in Ages of the higheſt Diſcovery, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Signory of the <hi>Putots,</hi> and <hi>William de Putot</hi> was in Poſſeſſion of it at his Death, which happened in the thirteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:103337:164"/>Houſe of <hi>Yorke,</hi> he was cruſhed and overwhelmed with that weight, with which the Partiſans of the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> Faction did endevour to ſink and oppreſſe the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of that Family, and was offered up a Victime to the ſucceſsful Fury of <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who being an Apoſtate of the Houſe of <hi>Yorke,</hi> was the principal Engine upon whom the Deſigns and Intereſs of the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> Party then moved: Upon the untimely Death and attaint of this Earl, which was in the year 1570. this Mannor was annexed to the Revenue of the Crown, and though <hi>Edward Tiptoft</hi> this mans Son, was the next year after his Fathers unhappy <hi>Exit,</hi> reſtored by <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, both in Blood and Dignity; yet I do not diſcover any Reſtitution made of <hi>Selling;</hi> ſo that it reſted in the Crown, until <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, in the fourth year of his reign, granted it to Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leger,</hi> who immediatly after paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Anthony Sonds</hi> of <hi>Throuley,</hi> one of the Juſtices of the Peace of this County, and Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to this Prince, and his Father <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, from whom it is now come down by Paternal efflux of the Title to Sir <hi>George Sonds</hi> Knight of the <hi>Bath,</hi> who is entituled to the preſent poſſeſſion of it.</p>

                  <hi>Oven-court</hi> in this Pariſh anciently gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family, which was known by that Denomination; but whether they were extracted from the <hi>Owens</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> and contracted this Name of <hi>Oven</hi> by vulgar Acceptation, no Record does manifeſt; certain it is they were, as appears by old Rentals and other Muniments, poſſeſſors of this place, as high as the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</p>
               <p>The next Family which (after this was worn out) did ſtep into the poſſeſſion, was <hi>Drilond</hi> of <hi>Cookes-ditch</hi> in <hi>Feverſham,</hi> a Name of generous Extraction; for in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Stephen de Drilond,</hi> demiſes ſome Land at <hi>Crouchfeild</hi> in <hi>Feverſham,</hi> by a Deed bearing Date from the twenty fifth year of that Prince, to <hi>William de Makenade,</hi> and in that Inſtrument he writes himſelf Knight. After <hi>Drilond</hi> was extinguiſhed, which was about the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, the <hi>Foggs</hi> became Proprietaries of it, and remained for divers years Lords of the Fee, until at laſt the alternate Devolution of Purchaſe brought it to be the Inheritance of <hi>Crouch,</hi> where it did not long fix, for in the year 1588. <hi>Giles Crouch</hi> alienated it to <hi>Michael Sonds</hi> Eſquire, afterwards Knighted, from which Family in our Fathers Memory it was conveyed by Sale to <hi>Franklin,</hi> from whom the ſame Devolution hath brought it now to <hi>Lambe,</hi> who holds the inſtant Signory of it.</p>
               <p>Before I paſſe from <hi>Selling,</hi> I muſt inform the Reader, that the greateſt Honour which this Town acquired, was, that it was the Cradle of <hi>William Selling</hi> bred up amongſt the Monks of <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> who obtained Licence from the Chapter of that Covent, to travel into <hi>Italy,</hi> and proſecute his Studies at <hi>Bononia,</hi> where he arrived to that perfection of Knowledge, that he was advanced to be Prior of <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church,</hi> and was after ſent by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, in whoſe Eyes his Worth was very viſible, as his Embaſſador to the Pope.

                  <hi>Smeth</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Bircholt,</hi> hath in the Limits of it <hi>Scots-hall</hi> which is now and hath been for divers Deſcents the Inheritance of eminent Gentlemen of that Sirname, whom I dare aver, upon probable Grounds were originally called <hi>Balioll. William Balioll,</hi> ſecond Brother to <hi>Alexander de Balioll,</hi> frequently writ his Name <hi>William de Balioll le Scot,</hi> and it is probable, that upon the Tragedy of <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Atholl,</hi> who was made priſoner by <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and barbarouſly executed, in the year 1307. (whilſt he endevoured more nobly then ſucceſsfully to defend the gaſping Liberty of <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt the Eruptions of that Prince;) this Family to decline the Fury of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, who was a man of violent paſſions, altered the Name of <hi>Balioll,</hi> to that of their Extraction and Country, and aſſumed for the future the Name of <hi>Scot.</hi> That the Sirname of this Family was originally <hi>Balioll,</hi> I farther upon theſe Reaſons aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. Firſt, the ancient Arms of <hi>Balioll</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> which was founded by <hi>John Balioll,</hi> and dedicated to St. <hi>Katharine,</hi> was a <hi>Katharin-Wheele,</hi> being ſtill part of the paternal Coat of this Family. Secondly, <hi>David de Strabogie,</hi> who was Son and Heir to the infortunate Earl aboveſaid, aſtoniſhed with an Example of ſo much Terror, altered his Name from <hi>Balioll</hi> to <hi>Strabogie,</hi> which was a Signory which accrued to him in Right of his Wife, who was Daughter and Heir to <hi>John Comin</hi> Earl of <hi>Badzenoth</hi> and <hi>Strabogie,</hi> and by this Name King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, omitting that of <hi>Balioll,</hi> reſtored <hi>Chilham-caſtle</hi> to him for Life, in the fifteenth year of his reign. Thirdly, the Earls of <hi>Bucleugh,</hi> and the Barons of <hi>Burley</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who derive themſelves originally from <hi>Balioll,</hi> are known at this inſtant by no other Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name; but <hi>Scot,</hi> and bear, with ſome inconſiderable Difference, thoſe very Arms which are at preſent the paternal Coat of this Family of <hi>Scots-hall.</hi> Having thus traced out the Name, I ſhall now repreſent a Scale of thoſe eminent Perſons, who have either directly or collaterally been extracted from <hi>Scots-hall.</hi> Sir <hi>William Scot,</hi>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:103337:165"/>who was knighted the tenth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, was Lord Chief Juſtice, and Knight Marſhal of <hi>England,</hi> in the reign of that Prince. Sir <hi>Robert Scot</hi> was Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> in the year 1424. Sir <hi>John Scot</hi> was Comptroller of the Houſe, one of the Privy Councel to <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and Marſhal of <hi>Calais. Thomas Scot</hi> who was firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> next of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> Provoſt of <hi>Beverley,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and Privy Councellor to King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, altered his Name from <hi>Scot</hi> to <hi>Rotheram,</hi> as being the place of his Education and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; but, it is probable, originally iſſued out from this Family. Sir <hi>William Scot,</hi> who was Son to Sir <hi>John</hi> above-mentioned, was Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports. Sir <hi>John Scot</hi> his Son, was knighted by the Prince of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> for ſignal Service perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by him, againſt the Duke of <hi>Gueldres.</hi> Sir <hi>Reginald Scot</hi> was Captain of the Caſtle of <hi>Callis.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Scot</hi> was Commander in Chief of the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Forces, who aſſembled upon the plains by <hi>Northbourn,</hi> to oppoſe the Spaniſh Invaſion, in the year 1588. All of which were either directly or collaterally Predeceſſors (being of the ſame Family) to <hi>Edward Scot,</hi> now Proprietary of <hi>Scots-hall</hi> Eſquire, who was Son and Heir of Sir <hi>Edward Scot,</hi> who was made Knight of the Bath, at the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of K. <hi>Charles.</hi>

The next whom I find by the ſame Evidences ſetled in the Inheritance, is <hi>Thomas Totihurſt,</hi> and he held it in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and had Iſſue <hi>Robert Totihurſt,</hi> who was, as appears by an Inſcription upon his Tomb, Servant to Cardinal <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier,</hi> and died poſſeſt of this Mannor, in the year 1512. and tranſmitted it to his Son <hi>Thomas Totihurſt</hi> Eſquire, Juſtice of Peace of this County, who about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> alienated it to Sir ...... <hi>Boſwell</hi> Grand-father to Sir <hi>Leonard Boſwell,</hi> who dying without Iſſue, his Siſter the Lady ...... <hi>Boſwell,</hi> Widow of Sir <hi>William Boſwell,</hi> as Heir General to her Brother, is now entered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brabourne</hi> is the ſecond place of Account. The firſt whom I find poſſeſt it, was <hi>Baldwin de Betun</hi> Earl of <hi>Albemarle. Falcatius de Brent,</hi> who ſo vigorouſly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Cauſe and Quarrel of King <hi>John</hi> againſt his Barons, and afterwards merited very much of his Son <hi>Henry</hi> the third, at the Battle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> where a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of thoſe Forces which <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Dolphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had tranſported into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> to ſupport the Confederacie of the Seditious Barons, was diſſipated and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited. But afterwards, all National Animoſities being charmed into Slumber by a general Peace, he deſiring ſtill to improve the Flame of War ſince from that he expected both Heat and Light, ſeiſed on the Caſtle of <hi>Bedford,</hi> which was not wrung from him without the Expence of much Blood and Treaſure: to expiate which Crime, his Eſtate here and elſe where, was in the fifth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, forfeited to the Crown, as being the Price of ſo great an Inſolence: And then the aboveſaid Monarch granted it wholly to <hi>Baldwin de Betun</hi> Earl of <hi>Albemarle:</hi> and <hi>Hawis</hi> his Daughter and Co-heir, brought it to her Husband <hi>William Mareſchall</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke:</hi> but <hi>Gilbert Mareſchall</hi> this mans Succeſſor, dying without Iſſue,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:103337:167"/>
                  <hi>Roger de Bigod</hi> Earl of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> in Right of <hi>Mawde</hi> his Mother, who was his Siſter and Heir, entered upon it, and he, in the eleventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, gives it to <hi>Otho</hi> Lord <hi>Grandiſon.</hi> After this Family was worn out, I find by an ancient Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll, one <hi>Walter de Pevenley</hi> or <hi>Pemley,</hi> poſſeſt of it, in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and he it is poſſible erected the Houſe, which in old Deeds is written <hi>Peven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> or <hi>Pemley-court.</hi> But, before the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, this Family was extinguiſhed and gone, and then the <hi>Aſhe's</hi> were the ſucceeding Proprietaries, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily which before were Lords of much Land in this Track, and in ancient Deeds were written <hi>de Fraxino,</hi> from their Habitation near ſome place planted with thoſe Trees; and it is probable derived their Deſcent from <hi>Thomas de Eſſe,</hi> who was one of the <hi>Recognitores Magnae Aſſiſae,</hi> in the fourth year of King <hi>John,</hi> as appears by the Pipe-rols of that Time: and certainly to this Name did a conſiderable part of the Fabrick of the Houſe owe its firſt Original, as appears by the Coat in divers of the Windows, <hi>videlicet, Azure three Cheverons Argent.</hi> In fine, after this Seat and Mannor had for many years been reſident in this Family, it was about the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> alienated to Sir ...... <hi>Boſwell,</hi> whoſe Grand-child dying without Iſſue, his Siſter the Lady <hi>Margaret Boſwell,</hi> is now become the Heir Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rumpſted</hi> and in very old Evidences written <hi>Rumpſhot,</hi> was the Inheritance of a Family, which was known by that Sirname. It is ſuperfluous to inform the World how many, by old Deeds, are repreſented to have been poſſeſſors of this place, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom Sir <hi>William de Rumpſted</hi> is moſt eminent, who flouriſhed here, in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and, as the conſtant and ſucceſſive Tradition of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this Pariſh is, was Foſter-father to <hi>William de Sevenoke,</hi> who was found a deſolate and forlorn Orphan in the hollow Body of an Oake, and received both Reception and Education from the Charity and Benevolence of the above-mentioned Perſon: In whoſe Lineage the propriety of this place did not long after ſettle; for by an old Court-roll, I find it in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, in the Tenure of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell:</hi> but this Family not long after determining in a Female Heir, ſhe by matching with <hi>Bere,</hi> brought it to acknowledge it ſelf to be of the Intereſt of this Family, but ſtaid not long in the Name; for about the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, it was made by purchaſe the poſſeſſion of <hi>Peckham,</hi> from whom not many years after, by the ſame fatality it went away to <hi>Bedell. Nicholas Bedell,</hi> in the third and fourth of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> demiſed it to <hi>John Stacy</hi> of <hi>Hollenden,</hi> and <hi>John Stacy,</hi> in the fourth and fifth of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> conveyes it to <hi>Richard Lone,</hi> and his Succeſſor Mr. <hi>Richard Lone</hi> hath very lately by Sale tranſmitted his Intereſt here to <hi>Thomas Lambert,</hi> formerly of <hi>Weſt-Combe</hi> in <hi>Greenwich</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knoll</hi> is the laſt place of Account in <hi>Sevenoke:</hi> It had, in Times of elder Inſcription, the ſame Owners with <hi>Brabourne,</hi> and <hi>Seale,</hi> not far diſtant, as namely, <hi>Falcatius de brent, Baldwin de Betun</hi> Earl of <hi>Albemarle, William Mareſchall</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and <hi>Roger de Bigod</hi> Earl of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who in the eleventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, granted it with <hi>Seale,</hi> and much other Land, which devolved to him in Right of <hi>Mawde</hi> his Mother, who was Siſter and Heir to her Brother <hi>Gilbert le Mareſchall</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> to <hi>Otho de Grandiſon,</hi> and in his Deſcendants did it continue until the beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and then it was conveyed by Sir <hi>Thomas Grandiſon</hi> to <hi>Geffrey de Say;</hi> yet I do not find that the poſſeſſion of this place was entirely plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> for an Inquiſition taken after the Death of <hi>Reginald de Cobham,</hi> in the thirty fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 62. <hi>Parte primâ,</hi> repreſents him to have had ſome ſhare or concernment in it; yet how ever it were thus broken into parcels, the Inheritance of this Mannor, was wholly, after this, placed in <hi>Geffrey de Say,</hi> as appears by ſome Court-rols, which commence from the reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: but he determining in Daughters and Co-heirs, <hi>Joan</hi> one of them upon the Diviſion of his Eſtate, brought this as an Addition to the Patrimony of her Husband Sir <hi>William Fiennes:</hi> and in this Family, when the poſſeſſion had had a Reſpite, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, it was by Sir <hi>William Fiennes</hi> paſſed away by Sale to <hi>Thomas Bourchier</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who added much of Pompe and Magnificence, by a new Supplement or Superſtructure to the ancient Pile or Fabrick, and dying bequeathed it to the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as a convenient Pallace for his
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:103337:167"/>Succeſſors: but when <hi>William Warham</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, ſaw that the Grandeur of this Manſion was looked upon both with an Eye of Emulation and Envy, by the Laity of thoſe Times, he to allay that Murmure and Regret, in the twelfth year of the aboveſaid Prince, exchanged it with the Crown: and here it reſted, until <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, in the ſecond year of his reign, granted it to <hi>Edward Seymour</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> Protector of the Realm, in the Minority of that Prince. Who being convicted of Felony, in the fourth year of that King, it eſcheated back to the Crown: and then it was in that year, by a new Grant, ſetled on <hi>John Dudley</hi> Duke of <hi>Northumberland:</hi> but he being intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with the Fumes of Ambition, broke out into ſuch treaſonable and ſeditious practiſes, againſt the Right and Title of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> that they could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated, but with the Loſſe of his Life, and Forfeiture of his Eſtate: and then this Seat upon his unſucceſsful <hi>Exit,</hi> returning to the Crown, it was by the aboveſaid Princeſs granted to her Couſin <hi>Reginald Poole</hi> Cardinal, for his Life, and a year after, as he ſhould by Teſtament diſpoſe. After his Death, it reverts again to the Crown, and then Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the third year of her reign, grants it to <hi>Robert Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceiſter,</hi> and he the ſame year reſigning it back into the Hands of his Soveraign, it was by Leaſe made over to <hi>John Lennard</hi> of <hi>Chevening</hi> Eſquire: but the Fee-ſimple was by Royal Conceſſion inveſted, in the ſeventh year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in <hi>Thomas Sackvill</hi> Lord <hi>Buckhurſt,</hi> and his Grand-child <hi>Richard Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> almoſt in our Remembrance, conveyed the Fee-ſimple (reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it yet ſtill in Leaſe to himſelf and his Heirs, paying ſuch a Rent-charge, as is there ſpecified, for ninety and nine years) to Mr. <hi>Richard Smith,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Dog-Smith:</hi> who upon his Deceaſe, not many years ſince, ſetled the propriety of it for ever upon St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Hoſpital in <hi>Southwarke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Honour of <hi>Sevenoke</hi> was granted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to her Kinſman <hi>Henry Carey</hi> Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> in the firſt year of her reign, from whom it devolved to his Grand-child <hi>Henry Carey</hi> Earl of <hi>Dover:</hi> he paſſed it away by Sale to <hi>Richard Sackvill</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> who alienated his Intereſt in it to Mr. <hi>Richard Smith,</hi> who upon his above-mentioned Deceaſe, gave it with <hi>Knoll,</hi> which both were exchanged, and ſo united to the Royal Demeaſne by <hi>William Warham,</hi> to the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>Southwarke.</hi>

                  <hi>Kepington</hi> is the laſt place conſiderable in this Pariſh, which was wrapt up in that Demeaſne, which owned the Signory of the Lords <hi>Cobham</hi> of <hi>Cobham,</hi> as appears by an Inquiſition taken, in the thirty fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot.

               <p>
                  <hi>Spelherſt</hi> in the Hundreds of <hi>Somerden, Codſheath,</hi> and <hi>Watchling ſtone,</hi> hath many places in it of Repute. Firſt, <hi>Grome-bridge</hi> which is a Chappel of Eaſe belonging to <hi>Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſt,</hi> and is dedicated to St. <hi>John:</hi> it is in old Regiſters written <hi>Gromen-bridge,</hi> and <hi>Gormen-bridge</hi> from ſome <hi>Saxon,</hi> who was anciently Owner of it, as <hi>Godmancheſter</hi> in <hi>Huntingtonſhire,</hi> upon the ſame Account, in old Orthography, bears the Name of <hi>Gormoncheſter,</hi> a <hi>Saxon</hi> having been poſſeſſor of it of that Denomination. This Mannor in elder Times confeſſed the Dominion and Title of the Noble Family of <hi>Cobham: Henry de Cobham,</hi> and <hi>Joan</hi> his Wife, obtained a Market to be obſerved weekly on the Thurſday, and a Fair three Dayes yearly, <hi>videlicet,</hi> the <hi>Vigil,</hi> the Day of St. <hi>John Port-latine,</hi> and the Day after, as is manifeſt from an old Charter, which I have ſeen, whoſe Date commences from the fourteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, the Market and Fair were kept, where now the new Chappel is erected by the piety and expence of that Worthy Patriot <hi>John Packer</hi> Eſquire, late one of the Clerks of the Privy Seal. After the <hi>Cobhams</hi> were departed from the poſſeſſion of this place, the Lords <hi>Clinton</hi> became, by purchaſe, Proprietaries of it: and <hi>John de Clinton,</hi> who was often ſummoned to fit as Baron in Parliament, in the Time of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, died poſſeſt of it, in the twenty ſecond year of that Prince,

               <p>There was a Chauntry founded at <hi>Grome-bridge,</hi> in the thirty eighth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, by <hi>VVilliam Ruſſell,</hi> and <hi>Hawis</hi> his Wife, as appears by the firſt Book of Compoſitions <hi>in Regiſtro Roffenſi.</hi>

                  <hi>Hollands</hi> in this Pariſh next cals for a View: It was, in Ages of a very high Date, the Patrimony of a Noble Family of that Sirname, and are in the Chartularies of this Pariſh, recorded to have been great Benefactors to the Church of <hi>Spelherſt,</hi> and were allied to <hi>Thomas Holland</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> who matched with <hi>Joan</hi> Daughter of <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>VVoodſtock:</hi> but, before the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, this Family was worn out, and vaniſhed, and then the <hi>VVallers</hi> ſtepped into the poſſeſſion, in which Family the Right of it did many years reſide, until it was in our Fathers Memory alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to <hi>Thomas Sackville</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> from whoſe Succeſſor it paſſed away by Sale to <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and from him, not many years ſince, the like Revolution carried it off to <hi>Caldicot.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ferbies</hi> is another Seat of no vulgar Conſideration in <hi>Spelherſt,</hi> if we conſider that it gave Sirname to a Family of important Account in this Track, who had their ancient Reſidence at this place, and ſealed as high as <hi>Edward</hi> the third, with a <hi>Feſſe Ermin between three Goats heads eraſed, in Labells affixed to their Deeds,</hi> which was the Paternal Coat-Armour of <hi>John de Fereby</hi> (for ſo is the Name written in ancient Muniments) who flouriſhed, in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Edward</hi> the third.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ruſt-hall</hi> in this Pariſh, had likewiſe Proprietaries of that Sirname, one of which Family called <hi>John Ruſt,</hi> was Maior of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> in the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and there lyes entombed, and about that Age. this Family ſurrendered their Concernment here by Sale to <hi>Waller,</hi> in which Name it reſided, untill the forty ſecond
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:103337:168"/>year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and then it was conveyed by <hi>Richard Waller</hi> Eſquire, to Mr. <hi>George Stacy;</hi> who not long after paſſed it away to <hi>Bing,</hi> in which Family the Poſſeſſion is at this inſtant fixed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ewherſt</hi> is the laſt place which muſt be mentioned, and indeed it is worth our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, becauſe this and <hi>Read</hi> in <hi>Marden,</hi> was the ancient Patrimony of <hi>Read,</hi> many Diſcents before. Sir <hi>Robert Read</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, tranſplanted himſelf to <hi>Chiddingſtone,</hi> by matching with the Coheir of <hi>Alphew,</hi> yet ſtill remained Poſſeſſor of this place, which he tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Katharine</hi> one of his four Daughters and Coheirs, matched with Sir <hi>Thomas Willoughbie,</hi> and after the Title had been knit to this Family, by the Links of ſome Diſcents, it was by Sale not long ſince transferred to <hi>Knight.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Siberts-would</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Shepeards-well,</hi> lies in the Hundred of <hi>Bewsborough,</hi> and hath two places in it worth our Notice. The firſt is <hi>Weſt-court,</hi> which was given (as the Records of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> teſtifie) to <hi>Alfric</hi> the Abbot, by King <hi>Etheldred</hi> in the year 944, and conveyed not long after by <hi>Scotlandus</hi> the Abbot his Succeſſor, to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and hath been ever ſince as a Limbe or Branch of that See.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upton-court</hi> is a ſecond place of Repute. Several old dateleſſe Deeds diſcover to us, that it was in elder Times the Patrimony of a Family called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton:</hi> from whom it is probable, that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ptons</hi> of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> who for many years have flouriſhed there under a fair Eſtimate of Antiquity, were originally deſcended: but before the end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, this Family was crumbled away at this place, and then the <hi>Golds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghs</hi> or <hi>Goldsboroughs,</hi> were inveſted in the Poſſeſſion, and remained Maſters of this Seat, untill the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and then this Name began to moulder away into Decay and Oblivion, and ſurrendred their Intereſt here by Sale to <hi>Guldford,</hi> in which Name it found an aboad, untill the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was conveyed to <hi>John Bois</hi> Eſquire, Anceſtor to <hi>John Bois</hi> of <hi>Fredvill</hi> Esq; now Lord and Proprietary of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Swink-field</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Folkstone,</hi> was originally, and as high as any Evidence will leave us any Track or Print to walk by to a Diſcovery, the Poſſeſſion of the noble Family of <hi>Crioll,</hi> who held here two little Manors called <hi>Bouington alias Bointon,</hi> and <hi>Northcourt,</hi> which were both given by <hi>Nicholas Keriell</hi> or <hi>Crioll,</hi> in the third year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, to one <hi>John Phineux</hi> Eſquire, for that Protection and Shelter, which he by a Magnanimous and vigorous Aſſiſtance ſupplied him with, even to the ſaving of his Life, at the Battle of <hi>Polcteirs,</hi> and being thus faſtned to this Family, the Intereſt of both theſe places, continued intermingled with their Inheritance, untill they came, by ſucceſſive Diſcent, to be poſſeſt by <hi>John Phineux</hi> Eſquire, extracted from a Son by a ſecond Wife of Sir <hi>Jo.

But it ſeems the Title of Church-Land is ſtuck ſo thick with the Curſes of the firſt Donors, that it becomes like a Moath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into a Garment, which like an ingrateful Gueſt, commonly deſtroyes the Houſe which entertained it, and ſo it was here; for, in the ſame year it was granted, the aboveſaid Perſon alienated it to <hi>George Brook</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> whoſe infortunate Grandchild <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> was enwrapped in that obſcure and myſterious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> which was muffled up in ſuch a complicated Veile of that magical Miſt called Reaſon of State, and other Intrigues of wreſted policy, that it remains dark and perplexed, until this Day; indeed the Crimes of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Gentleman, were by the mercenary Tongues of ſome Lawyers, who were in penſion to the Intereſt of thoſe, who then ſteared the Helm of State, and who like ſome Trumpeters, knew how to ſell their Breath to the beſt advantage, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and multiplied to that Bulk and Dimenſion, that he was convicted of high Treaſon, in the beginning of King <hi>James,</hi> and though he loſt not his Life, he did that of his Eſtate, here at <hi>Stroude,</hi> which was by the aboveſaid Prince conferred by Grant on <hi>Robert Cecill</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> principal Secretary of Eſtate, in Reſpect he had matched with <hi>Elizabeth Brook,</hi> Siſter to this infortunate Lord, from whom it deſcended to his Son, the Right Honorable <hi>William Cecill,</hi> Captain of the Band

               <p>The Chappel of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> in <hi>Stroud,</hi> was by <hi>Gilbert Glanvill</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> with the Conſent of the Prior of <hi>Rocheſtor, William</hi> Arch-deacon of the ſame See, and likewiſe of the Pariſh Prieſt of <hi>Frendsbury</hi> (within the Precincts of whoſe Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, Church, and Congregation, it was in elder Times circumſcribed) erected, and improved into a Mother-church, and that for theſe two Reaſons.

And although the Structure of this Houſe, hath like a Snail ſhifted its ancient Shell, yet in all its Mutations, and Viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, which muſt certainly have very much diſordered the Fabrick, when it was caſt into a new mould and frame, and ravelled and diſcompoſed the Materials: yet this Panel of Wainſcot, hath been, like a Relique, religiouſly preſerved, to juſtifie not only the Antiquity of this Seat, but of the Family of <hi>Sydley</hi> alſo, which is preſumed to have been reſident at this place, before the above-mentioned Calculation: from whom Sir <hi>Charles Sidley</hi> Baronet, claims the Original of his Title to this Manſion, and his Extraction or pedigree likewiſe, untwiſted, into many Deſcents, and now at laſt wound up in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shouldon</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Deal,</hi> hath two remarkable places which are ſituated within the Limits of it. Firſt, <hi>Hull</hi> preſents it ſelf to our View, it was formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Signory of the illuſtrious-Family of <hi>Ratling</hi> or <hi>Retling</hi> in <hi>Nonington. Thomas de Retling</hi> paid reſpective Aid for this, and divers other Lands of ancient Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight, and left it to his Son Sir <hi>Richard de Retling,</hi> whoſe Widow the Lady <hi>Sarah Retling,</hi> and afterwards Wife of <hi>John de St. Laurence,</hi> died poſſeſt of it in the tenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and left it to <hi>John Spicer</hi> who had married <hi>Joan</hi> Daughter and Heir to her firſt Husband: but he concluding in a Daughter and Heir, by this his firſt Wife called <hi>Cicely,</hi> who was Heir to her mother <hi>Joan Spicer,</hi> ſhee by matching with <hi>Iohn Iſaack,</hi> knit it to the Propriety of that Family. But before the twenty firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, he had fixed the Inheritance in <hi>Iohn Breſland,</hi> in whom it was not long reſident; for he ſuddenly after altered his right, and about the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, put it over by Sale to <hi>Phineux</hi> of <hi>Swink-field,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Phineux,</hi> by as quick and early a Viciſſitude, placed the poſſeſſion about the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in <hi>George Monins</hi> Eſquire; whoſe Succeſſor in that Age which was circumſcribed within the Pale of our Fathers Remembrance, paſſed it away to <hi>Crayford</hi> of <hi>Great Mongeham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Cotmanton</hi> puts in its Claim for ſome memorial likewiſe, even in this reſpect, that it was the Demeaſne of the noble Family of <hi>Crioll</hi> or <hi>Keriell,</hi> who were of ſome conſiderable Repute in this Track, as appearsby by the Book ſtyled <hi>Teſta de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> kept in the Exchequer, where they are repreſented in the twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, to have held Land in this Skirt of the County, and in Ages of a modern Aſpect, that is, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, I find <hi>Iohn de Criol,</hi> gave a pecuniary ſupply at the making the Black Prince Knight: but before the end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, he was departed from the poſſeſſion of this place, which by Sale was reſigned up to <hi>Roger Digge,</hi> and he dyed in the poſſeſſion of it in the third year of <hi>Ric.</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num</hi> 19. And in this Family it continued, untill the reign of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:103337:173"/>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and then it was alienated to <hi>Barton,</hi> deſcended from the ancient Family of <hi>Barton,</hi> of <hi>Barton-hall,</hi> in the County of <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> from whom the like Mutation about the latter end of <hi>H.</hi> the eighth carried it off, to the Family of <hi>Brown;</hi> and from them it paſſed away by Sale into the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Richardſon,</hi> upon whoſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, the Family of <hi>Smith,</hi> by a Devolution like the former, not many years ſince, ſtept into the Inheritance of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sundrich</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Codſheath,</hi> was the Poſſeſſion (as high as any Light, collected from Antiquity, can waft us to a Diſcovery) of an Ancient Family called in Latine-Records <hi>de Inſula,</hi> and in Engliſh <hi>Iſley. Iohn de Inſula,</hi> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at <hi>Sundrich,</hi> in the eleventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and he had Iſſue <hi>Iohn Iſley,</hi> who married <hi>Joan,</hi> Daughter to Sir <hi>Ralph de Fremingham,</hi> and by her had Iſſue <hi>Roger Iſley</hi> Eſquire, who in Right of his mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Heir to his Uncle <hi>Iohn Fremingham</hi> Eſquire, who deceaſed without Iſſue, in the twelfth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and this <hi>Roger Iſley,</hi> had Iſſue <hi>William Iſley</hi> Eſquire, who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the twenty fifth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and he had Iſſue <hi>John Iſley</hi> Eſquire, who was Juſtice of the Peace, and Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the fourteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and deceaſed in the year 1484, as appears by an Inſcription affixed to his Monument, yet extant (notwithſtanding the late general Shipwrack of the Remains of Antiquity) in <hi>Sundrich-church,</hi> and he had Iſſue <hi>Thomas Iſley</hi> Eſquire, Father of Sir <hi>Henry Iſley,</hi> who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and again in the fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth: but being unhappily entangled, in the dyſaſtrous Attempt of Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat,</hi> was upon the fruſtrating of that Deſigne and the Diſſipation, and Diſcomfiture of thoſe Forces who were to ſupport it; in the ſecond year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> convicted and attainted of high Treaſon, and executed at <hi>Sevenoke;</hi> upon whoſe Tragedy this Mannor with all its Appendages eſcheated to the Crown: but was the ſame year reſtored to his Son <hi>William Iſley</hi> Eſquire, who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> part of the ſeventh year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> after whoſe deceaſe, the Title of this place, which had ſo many Centuries of years like an Inmate dwelt in this Name and Family, ebbed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to another Proprietary; for in our Fathers Memory it was alienated by Sale to <hi>Brooker,</hi> who not many years ſince, paſſed it away to Mr. <hi>John Hide,</hi> ſecond Son to Mr. <hi>Bernard Hide,</hi> one of the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtome-houſe to his late Majeſtie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brook-place</hi> in <hi>Sundrich,</hi> ſo called from its contiguous Situation neer ſome Drill of Water, did acknowledge for many diſcents, the Signory of <hi>Iſley,</hi> the laſt of whom who dyed poſſeſt of it, was <hi>William Iſley</hi> Eſquire, who held it at his Deceaſe, which was in the fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 34. After whoſe <hi>Exit,</hi> it came to <hi>John Iſley</hi> Eſquire, who not long after, paſſed it away to <hi>John Alphew,</hi> and he determinig in two Daughters and Coheirs, one of them by matching with Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Read</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, linked it to his Patrimony: but he likewiſe went out in four Daughters and Coheirs, <hi>Katharine</hi> one of which, was matched to Sir <hi>Thomas Willoughbie,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice likewiſe, of the Common Pleas, and ſo he in her right was poſſeſt of this place; from whom it came down to his Succeſſor, <hi>Thomas Willoughbie</hi> Eſquire, who about the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> conveyed it by Sale, to Mr. <hi>Hoskins</hi> of <hi>Oxted</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> deſcended from an ancient Family of that Name in <hi>Hereford-ſhire,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor Mr. <hi>Charles Hoskins,</hi> being lately deceaſed, the Fee-ſimple reſts now in his Son and Heir.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hethenden</hi> or <hi>Henden</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Sundrich,</hi> which was folded up in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſn of the powerful and illuſtrious Family of the <hi>Clares,</hi> who were Earls of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and Lords of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> by whoſe Heir general it devolved to <hi>Audley:</hi> and this Family by the ſame Fatality, languiſhing into a Female Inheritrix, ſhe by matching with <hi>Stafford,</hi> caſt this Mannor into his Revenue, and in this Name was the Propriety reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, untill, <hi>Edward Stafford</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> was infortunately attainted, in the thirteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, it was by eſcheat, annexed to the Demeaſn of the Crown, and made its aboad there, untill King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in the thirty fifth year of his reign, granted it to Sir <hi>John Greſham,</hi> and he dyed poſſeſt of it, in the firſt
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:103337:174"/>year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> after whoſe Deceaſe it remained conſtant to the Intereſs of this Family, until the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then it was alienated to Sir <hi>Thomas Hoskins</hi> of <hi>Oxſted</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> in the Deſcendants of which Family the Signory and Propriety is at this inſtant remaining.</p>

                  <hi>Sturrey</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Blengate,</hi> was a Mannor by a Preſcription of many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations wrapt up in the Patrimony of <hi>Apulderfeild,</hi> a Family whom we ſhall have occaſion often to mention thoroughout the Body of this Survey, and here it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till this Name met with its Tomb in a Daughter and Heir, known by the Name of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was wedded to Sir <hi>John Phineux:</hi> and although he likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a Female Heir, matched to <hi>John Roper</hi> Eſquire, who drew along with her a great portion of the Eſtate, yet this ſtill remained fixt in this Name and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even till our Fathers Memory; and then <hi>John Phineux</hi> Eſquire died, and left this, and other vaſt poſſeſſions to his Daughter and Sole Heir <hi>Elizabeth Phineux,</hi> who brought them over to her Husband Sir <hi>John Smith,</hi> eldeſt Son of Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> and Grand-father to <hi>Philip Smith</hi> Viſcount <hi>Strangford,</hi> who by Right planted in him by ſo worthy a Predeceſſor, does entitle himſelf to the Intereſs and poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mayton</hi> in this Pariſh, though now of no great Importance, yet formerly gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family that paſſed under that Appellation, from whom by Sale the Inheritance was tranſplanted into <hi>Diggs,</hi> where for ſome Deſcents, without any Interval it made its abode, till it was by <hi>Leonard Diggs</hi> Grand-father to Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs,</hi> ſold to <hi>Goodhugh,</hi> by whoſe Daughter and Heir it became the Demeaſne of <hi>Baggs,</hi> which Name likewiſe going out here into a Daughter and Heir, ſhe by matching not long ſince to <hi>Farmer,</hi> has made it to own him for its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant proprietary.</p>

                  <hi>Sutton</hi> by <hi>Walmer</hi> lies in the Hundred of <hi>Cornilo,</hi> and was the Inheritance of a good old Family, called <hi>Stroude.</hi> Peradventure it aſſumed its Denomination from the Shore not far diſtant, and was ſometimes, in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Denomination, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Strond,</hi> and as often <hi>Stroude; John de Stroude</hi> held it, as the Book of <hi>Aide</hi> denotes, in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and when this Family was worn out, the next who were inveſted in the poſſeſſion, were the <hi>Criols,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Criol</hi> or <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riel,</hi> held it at his death, which was in the third year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, whoſe Grand-child Sir <hi>Thomas Keriel</hi> being an active Champion of the Cauſe and Quarrel of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, againſt the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> was ſlain in the ſecond Battle of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> where the Title of both Parties was put to the bloody deciſion of a Field, who leaving only two Daughters and Co-heirs, one matching with <hi>John Fogge</hi> Eſquire, incorporated this into his Revenue, from whom by purchaſe, the Right was ſetled in <hi>Whitlock,</hi> where it tarried not long, but was by the like devolution tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into <hi>Maycot,</hi> from which Name the ſame Fate of Sale carried it into the poſſeſſion of <hi>Stokes,</hi> who in our memory by the like alienation, tranſmitted his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs here to <hi>Meryweather.</hi>

                  <hi>Sutton,</hi> commonly called <hi>Eaſt-Sutton,</hi> lies in the Hundted of <hi>Eyhorne,</hi> and was formerly the <hi>Braybrookes; Henry de Braybrooke,</hi> one of the Lord Wardens of the Cinque Ports, had Lands here; and in this Track (as the Book of <hi>Aide,</hi> and the Book called <hi>Feoda Militum,</hi> in the Exchequer, do both inform us) his Son was <hi>Gerard Braybrooke,</hi> and his Grand-child was <hi>Reginald Braybrooke,</hi> whoſe Heir <hi>Joan
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:103337:174"/>Braybrooke</hi> married to <hi>Thomas Brooke</hi> of the County of <hi>Somerſet:</hi> but whether this <hi>Reginald Braybrooke</hi> gave this Mannor to pious Uſes, or not, and principally to the Abby of <hi>Leeds</hi> adjacent, I cannot poſitively determine, upon the Suppreſſion it was granted (as being parcel of the Demeaſne of the Convent of <hi>Leeds</hi>) by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in the thirty ſeventh year of his reign to <hi>John Tufton</hi> Eſquire, who paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it away by Sale to Mr. <hi>Richard Argall,</hi> whoſe Heir <hi>Elizabeth Argall,</hi> being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Edward Filmer</hi> Eſquire, made it the poſſeſſion of that Family, and by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative Right from him, does his Grand-child Sir <hi>Edward Filmer,</hi> Son to Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> lately deceaſed, now hold the poſſeſſion and propriety of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sutton Valence,</hi> and <hi>Chart</hi> by <hi>Sutton,</hi> both lie in the Hundred of <hi>Eyhorne:</hi> the laſt of which contracted the Appellation, from formerly owning <hi>William de Valence</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> to be Lord of the Fee, who certainly inſtituted that Caſtle, that now even in its Reliques and Fragments with much of venerable Magnificence overlooks the Plain: And when <hi>Aymer de Valence</hi> his Son concluded in a Female Heir <hi>Iſabell,</hi> ſhe was wedded to <hi>Lawrence</hi> Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> who in relation to her became not only Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> but Lord of <hi>Sutton-Valence</hi> alſo, and from him did it deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to his Grand-child <hi>John Haſtings</hi> Earl of <hi>Fembroke,</hi> the laſt Earl there of that Name, who tranſmitted his Title of that place to <hi>Reginald Grey,</hi> and <hi>Richard Talbot,</hi> who flouriſhed here about the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and they had this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor by Teſtamentary Donation, in the fourteenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond. In the next Age ſubſequent to this, I find the <hi>Cliffords</hi> of <hi>Bobbing-court,</hi> to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries, and to this Family was the Inheritance in a conſtant Union faſtned, till <hi>Nicholas Clifford</hi> Eſquire, deceaſed without Iſſue-male, and left only one Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Heir, called <hi>Mildred,</hi> who was firſt married to <hi>Harper;</hi> ſecondly, to <hi>More;</hi> thirdly, to <hi>Warren;</hi> and laſtly, to <hi>Blount:</hi> but ſhe had only Iſſue by <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> and <hi>More;</hi> for in her Right <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>More</hi> of <hi>Mellifont</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Harper</hi> divided the Poſſeſſion: but the firſt deſiring to contract his whole Revenue into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the other to make this adjacent to his principal Seat of <hi>Ruſpar-hall</hi> in the County of <hi>Derby,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Harper</hi> alienated this to Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hales</hi> Knight and Baronet, and the Lord <hi>More, Chart</hi> by <hi>Sutton</hi> to the ſame worthy Perſon, Grand-father to Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> Baronet, who not only enjoyes the Title of his Anceſtors Dignity, but that of the Poſſeſſion in theſe places like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cheyneys-court</hi> in this Pariſh hath been adopted into that Name, ſince it for many Deſcents acknowledged the Juriſdiction and propriety of that Family: and I could unravel a Succeſſive Series of many of that Name (but that it is ſuperfluous) who were Lords of the Fee; it is enough, that Sir <hi>Thomas Cheyney</hi> ſold it to <hi>Iden,</hi> which Name ſuddenly after reſolving into two Daughters and Co-heirs, one matching with <hi>Brown,</hi> and the other with <hi>Barton,</hi> the laſt made it parcel of the Patrimony of that Family, and when ſome years it had been continued in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Barton,</hi> it was in our Memory by Sale brought over to be the Demeaſne of <hi>Wollett,</hi> and it is now (but whether by Purchaſe, or by the Right of a Female Heir or not, I cannot aſcertain my ſelf) the propriety of <hi>Jordan.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sutton</hi> at <hi>Hone</hi> lies in the Hundred of <hi>Acſtane,</hi> and gives Denomination to the whole <hi>Lath</hi> wherein it is ſituated. It was long ſince a Mannor relating to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Knights Hoſpitallers, who had here a Manſion-houſe, called St. <hi>Johns,</hi> where they often made their Retreat, when they viſited their other Demeaſne Land, which lay circumſcribed within the Verge of this County: but their Eſtate here was much inforced and improved by the Addition of the Mannor of <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> which whether it came to them by Purchaſe or Donation from <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> who died the forty ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, is incertain. Upon the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the <hi>Alberge</hi> of theſe Knights of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> their Revenue was aſſumed into the poſſeſſion of the Crown: and King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, beſtowed by Grant on Sir <hi>Maurice Dennis</hi> St. <hi>John's;</hi> and to him does that magnificent and elegant Pile, where now the Counteſs of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> makes her Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, owe the firſt Inſtitution of its Shape and Beauty, though it has been ſince
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:103337:175"/>extreamly inlarged by the Additions both of Bulk and Ornament by Sir <hi>Thomas Smith.</hi> But to proceed, St. <hi>Johns</hi> was conveyed from Sir <hi>Maurice Dennis</hi> by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heir to <hi>Thomas Cranfeild,</hi> whoſe Grand-child <hi>Vincent Cranfeild,</hi> has lately alienated his Right to Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Merchant.</p>

                  <hi>Haly Sawters</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Sutton</hi> in <hi>Hone:</hi> a place though now obſcure in it ſelf, and not re-preſented to our Remembrance but by Annals and Record, yet in elder Times it was raiſed up to a higher degree of Eſtimate, when it had Proprietaries, whoſe Nobility and Title added both Value and Luſtre unto it. The firſt of which Regiſter whom I trace in Record to be entituled to the Poſſeſſion was <hi>Laurence de Haſtings</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and he died ſeiſed of it in the twenty ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot.

Eſc. Num.</hi> 70. After this Family, had deſerted the Inheritance, I find <hi>Richard Fitz Allen</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> to be inveſted in the Poſſeſſion, and he died in the Tenure of it in the one and twentieth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 2. From whom it devolved to <hi>Joan</hi> his Daughter and Co-heir matched to <hi>William Beauchamp</hi> Baron of <hi>Aburgavenny,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Beauchamp</hi> dying without Iſſue Male, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Sole Daughter, eſpouſed to <hi>Edward Nevill</hi> Baron of <hi>Aburgavenny</hi> in her Right be came his Heir, and he in the ſixteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth died poſſeſt of this Mannor of <hi>Sawters.</hi> And here for want of Light both from publick or private Record; I cannot diſcover to my Reader or my ſelf whether or not it paſſed away immediately from <hi>Nevill</hi> to <hi>Maio,</hi> whom I find about the beginning of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to be planted in the Poſſeſſion, though the Affirmation of ſome old people of this Pariſh, who derived that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they have of it from the Tradition of their Anceſtors that aſſert it did. <hi>Thomas Maio</hi> in the twenty eighth of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> paſſed it away to <hi>Rich. Paramour,</hi> and he preſently after diſpoſed of it by Sale to Sir <hi>Henry Brooke,</hi> who conveyed it to <hi>Robert Wroth</hi> Eſquire, and he to <hi>Edmund Hunt</hi> Eſquire, who alienated <hi>Haly</hi> and <hi>Sawters</hi> to Mr. <hi>William Hewſon</hi> in the thirty fourth year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whoſe Son Mr. <hi>William Hewſon</hi> of <hi>London</hi> tranſmitted <hi>Haly</hi> with <hi>Sawters</hi> by Sale, ſome few years ſince, to Mr. <hi>Edward Badbie.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Grandiſons</hi> is the laſt place remarkable in this Pariſh: It was the ancient Inheritance of the noble and illuſtrious Family of <hi>Grandiſon;</hi> before <hi>Otho de Grandiſon,</hi> who was Governour of <hi>Jerſey</hi> for life by Grant from <hi>Edw.</hi> the firſt in the fifth year of his Reign, did tranſplant himſelf to <hi>Seale,</hi> which he had purchaſed in the thirteenth year of that Prince. <hi>William de Grandiſon</hi> this mans Son was likewiſe Lord of this place, to whom K. <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond aſſigned the Value of 44 <abbr>lb.</abbr> yearly Rent out of his Mannor of <hi>Dartford,</hi> in Exchange for the Mannor of <hi>Iden</hi> and other Lands in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and from this Man did the Signory of this Mannor accrue by Deſcent to his Grand-child Sir <hi>Thomas Grandiſon,</hi> who dying without Iſſue in the forty ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 62. left it partly to <hi>John de Northwood,</hi> who had married <hi>Agnes</hi> his Siſter and Co-heir, and partly to <hi>Margaret</hi> his Lady Dowager, who died poſſeſt of it in the eighteenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond: but after her <hi>Exit,</hi> the Title was not long permanent in <hi>Northwood;</hi> for in the twenty firſt year of the Prince aboveſaid, <hi>Richard Fitz Allen</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> held it, and died that year poſſeſt of it: And here I confeſs for want of Light and juſt intelligence I muſt make a Leap to the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then I find it in the Tenure of <hi>Richard Nevill</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and it is probable it devolved to him by the Heir of <hi>Beauchampe.</hi> After his Deceaſe it became the Poſſeſſion of <hi>George Duke</hi> of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who had matched with <hi>Iſabel</hi> his Daughter and Co-heir, by whom he had Iſſue <hi>Edward Plantagenet</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who was offered up on an early Scaffold, to the waking ſuſpitions, and weary Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, of thoſe two politick Princes, <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> being invited to an eſcape, from his long Dureſs in the <hi>Tower,</hi> by the Arts and Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems of that eminent Impoſtor, <hi>Perkin Warbeck:</hi> But indeed thoſe who have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated this Action, and ſurveyed the whole Scene of this Tragedy, have diſcovered that his nearneſs to the Crown, as being the laſt Relick of the Male-Line of <hi>Plantagenet,</hi> was the cheiefeſt Ingredient in the ſevere Sentence, of this infortunate Gentleman. After his expiration, this Mannor came over to be the Patrimony of his
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:103337:175"/>Siſter, <hi>Margaret</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who was matched to Sir <hi>Richard Poole,</hi> by which marriage this Mannor was annexed to his Demeaſn, and he had Iſſue by her <hi>Henry Poole,</hi> who with his Mother was attainted in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, upon whoſe fatal Shipwrack, <hi>Grandiſons</hi> was in the thirty fifth of that Prince placed by Grant in his Brother <hi>Geffrey Poole,</hi> who not long after paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Thomas Moile,</hi> by whoſe Daughter and Co-heir it came to be the Inheritance of Sir <hi>Thomas Kempe,</hi> and he about the tenth year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> conveyed it to Mr. <hi>Jo.

After <hi>Wallis</hi> was worn out, it fell under the Signory of a Family called <hi>Meſingham,</hi> but it ſeems was not long reſident in their Poſſeſſion: for about the beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Nicholas Meſingham</hi> releaſes to <hi>Thomas Chich</hi> all his Intereſs and Right in <hi>Tanington,</hi> and other Lands ſituated in <hi>Heckington</hi> and other places, but here likewiſe was the Poſſeſſion as brief and inconſtant; for before the Expiration of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, I find it by purchaſe from <hi>Chich</hi> and <hi>Wallis,</hi> ſetled in the Tenure of <hi>Geo. Ballard;</hi> and he died ſeiſed of it in the eighth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and in this Family did continue until the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and then it was alienated by <hi>Nicholas Ballard</hi> Eſquire, to Sir <hi>James Hales</hi> of the Dungeon; from whom the right by Succeſſive Delegation is now tranſmitted to Sir <hi>James Hales</hi> the inſtant Lord of the Fee.</p>

                  <hi>Barham Court</hi> in this Pariſh re-preſents to our remembrance, that it was once the Manſion or ancient reſidence of the noble and illuſtrious Family of <hi>Barham:</hi> this Name was, in Times of a very reverend Inſcription, written <hi>Fitz-Urſe.

                  <hi>Tenterden,</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Tenterden,</hi> had its denomination, as ſome vulgar Phanſies conjecture, from the tenderneſs of the Soile adjacent to it: but indeed it was in elder and more true Orthography, written <hi>Theinwarden,</hi> that is, the <hi>Thanes</hi> or <hi>Theins, Ward,</hi> or <hi>Guard</hi> in the Valley; for it was very probable it was ſubſervient to that Signory or Dominion, which the Governour of <hi>Andredſwaldt</hi> (ſo called by the <hi>Saxons:</hi> but <hi>Anderida</hi> by the <hi>Romans</hi>) did exerciſe, and pretend to, in this Track of the County.

                  <hi>Tong</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Milton,</hi> was anciently called <hi>Thewng</hi> and <hi>Thawng,</hi> which import as much in <hi>Saxon,</hi> as <hi>Thong</hi> in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for the common Opinion derived from a univerſal Tradition, and that aſſerted and juſtified by an uninterrupted Aſſent of elder Times, is, That <hi>Vortiger</hi> the <hi>Britiſh</hi> King, gave <hi>Hengiſt</hi> and <hi>Horſa,</hi> as a Symbol and Pledge of his Affection, ſo much Land to erect a Fortreſs on, as could be environed and circumſcribed, by the Hide of a Beaſt cut into Thongs, which accordingly was performed, and the Caſtle thus eſtabliſhed, in Memory of the original Donation, was in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Dialect ſtyled <hi>Thwangceoſter</hi> or <hi>Thong-caſtle:</hi> and this Story is made more probable and plauſible, becauſe <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> affirms that <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius</hi> by many provocations endevoured to engage <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> and his <hi>Saxons</hi> to a Battle at <hi>Tong</hi> in <hi>Kent:</hi> and that there was a Caſtle here, the Fragments and Remains of ſome Fortifications near the Mill, do eaſily evince; though they lie now gaſping in ſo deplored an heap, that only the Rubbiſh of its Ruines are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable; yet certainly in elder Times it was a Fortreſs of Importance; for the Moat of the Caſtle is yet ſo wide and deep, that it contributes Water enough to drive a Mill.

                  <hi>Binbery</hi> is an eminent Mannor in this Pariſh, which, as high as the Teſtimony of any either publick or private Evidences can inſtruct me, did own the Signory of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.

                  <hi>Tunbridge</hi> gives Name to that we ſtyle the <hi>Lowy</hi> of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and is a ſmall Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory within it ſelf, called in old Latine Records <hi>Diſtrictus Leuca de Tunbridge,</hi> and was formerly ſubſervient to the Dominion of thoſe noble Perſons, who were Lords of the Fee. The firſt of which, was <hi>Richard de Clare</hi> Earl of <hi>Brionie</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> to whom it was by <hi>William Rufus</hi> granted upon this emergent Occaſion. This <hi>Richard</hi> was an earneſt Abettor and ſupporter likewiſe of the Deſignes of this Prince, upon his Brothers Territories in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and ſo by conſequence an active partiſan of his, which made the Breaſt of <hi>Robert Duke</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> to boile with ſuch Animoſity and paſſion againſt Him, that the Flame of his Hatred kindled the Flame of a War which could not be extinguiſhed, but by the Depredation of this Earl's Eſtate, and the utter ſubverſion of his Caſtle of <hi>Brionie,</hi> which was left an Heap of Flame and Ruines, which cauſed <hi>William Rufus</hi> to riſent his Calamitous Condition with ſo much Regret and Commiſeration, that he granted him as much Land here at <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> as would ſpread into a League both in the Extent and Longitude of it, and in the Breadth and Latitude of it likewiſe; and <hi>Gemeticenſis</hi> reports that this <hi>Richard</hi> brought over the Rope with which he was to meaſure it, in the ſame Ship which tranſported him and his Retinue. From this <hi>Richard</hi> who founded the Caſtle, the right of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> was by Deſcent tranſlated into his Son <hi>Gilbert de Clare</hi> the firſt Earl of <hi>Hertford</hi> and here did the Signory many years find a reſidence, till <hi>Iſabel</hi> Siſter and Coheir of <hi>Gilbert de Clare</hi> by matching with <hi>Hugh Audley,</hi> brought this to be the Inheritance of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:103337:180"/>that illuſtrious Family, where it had not long remained, but <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>Hugh Audley</hi> by marrying with <hi>Ralph Stafford</hi> made it a Branch of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony: nor did it depart from this Family, till the Vanitie of <hi>Edward Stafford</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> embarked him in that Deſign, which the Malice of Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> aggravated with thoſe Circumſtances of Hatred, by blowing of wild Conjectures into the Ears of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, who was naturally a jealous Prince, and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of any new blooming Glory, that he was ſtained with the black Tincture of Treaſon, which ſunk him into an untimely Sepulcher, and his Eſtate by forfeiture into the poſſeſſion of the Crown. <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> being thus convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the twelfth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, there was a great Controverſie ſtarted forth, in the thirteenth year of that Prince's reign, as appears by our Law-books, in the Parliament then convened, whether or not there were ground enough in the Crimes objected againſt him to eſtabliſh an Attainder upon: and it was carried in the Affirmative that there was; upon which this Caſtle, with all the Mannor of <hi>Dach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt, alias Hilden-borough,</hi> with all the appendant Services and Quit-rents united to them, did eſcheat to the Crown, and remained there, until Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> diſſevered the Mannor of the Caſtle from her Intereſt, and made it by Grant the poſſeſſion of her Kinſman <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> about the beginning of King <hi>James,</hi> paſſed it with his Daughter and Heir to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Berkley,</hi> who conveyed it to Sir <hi>John Kenedie,</hi> from whom not long after, by the ſame Conveyance it fell under the divided Signory of <hi>Ferrers, Goſſon,</hi> and <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and they by a mutual Conſent ſold their Intereſt in it to Sir <hi>Peter Vanlore,</hi> by whoſe three Daughters and Co-heirs, matched to Sir <hi>Henry Zinzin,</hi> Sir <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Sterling,</hi> and <hi>Robert Crooke</hi> Eſquire, it is now divided between thoſe three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. Although the Onſets of Time, and the Aſſaults of Enemies together, hath thrown the Beauty and Strength into ſuch a rude Confuſion, that it now lurks in its own Rubbiſh; yet formerly it was eminent for being the Scene of much Feude and Contention, between the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and the Barons then in Arms againſt them.</p>
               <p>In the year 1088. <hi>Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bajeux</hi> and Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> making a Defection from <hi>William Rufus,</hi> to thoſe Barons who ſought to ſupport the Title of his eldeſt Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> placed one <hi>Gilbert</hi> in this Caſtle, for the Defence of it, which enforced that King to inveſt it with a Siege, and compelled the <hi>Caſtellan</hi> to a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, and afterwards having taken <hi>Odo</hi> himſelf, impriſoned him in this Fortreſs, from whence he afterwards made a ſucceſsful Eſcape.</p>
               <p>In the year 1215. <hi>Falcatius de Brent,</hi> during the Military Conteſts King <hi>John</hi> had with his Nobility, by Force wrung this Caſtle from the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and maintained it for ſome Time with ſignal Evidences of Magnanimity to the Kings Behoof and Uſe.</p>
               <p>In the year 1231. upon the Deceaſe of <hi>Gilbert,</hi> the then Earl of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> ſeiſed the Wardſhip of his Heir, and entruſted the Cuſtody of this Caſtle to <hi>Hubert de Burgh</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent.</hi> This occaſioned an eager and impetuous Conteſt between the King, and <hi>Richard</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> the Arch-biſhop pretended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Caſtle held of his See, therefore he, <hi>de Jure,</hi> ought to have the Cuſtody of the Heir in his Wardſhip. To which the King replyed, that the whole Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome held of him, and that he might commit the Cuſtody of the Lands to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pleaſed. This cauſed the Arch-biſhop, boyling with much Heat and Paſſion, to Appeal for Redreſs to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he managed this Controverſie with that vigorous dexterity, that the Pope iſſued out a ſolemn determination on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half: but his Deceaſe in his Journey homewards, ſuperſeded the Execution of the Papal Sentence.</p>
               <p>The above-mentioned King <hi>Henry,</hi> in the year 1259. granted Licence to <hi>Richard de Clare</hi> Earl of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> to wall and embattle his Town of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> in theſe Words in that Charter, <hi>Claudere Muro et Kernellare,</hi> which latter Word being made Latine out of the French <hi>Charneaux,</hi> imports that indented Form of the Top of a Wall, which hath Vent and Creſt, commonly called embattelling, very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Defendants within, not only to annoy the Enemy, but likewiſe to ſhroud and ſecure himſelf from the Fury of any outward Aſſault.</p>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:103337:180"/>
               <p>This Mode of Fortification was in elder Time with much Caution prohibited within this Nation, out of a Jealouſie that it might foment any inward Sedition, and was therefore, amongſt many other Articles, inquirable before the <hi>Eſcheator de Domibus Kerneliatis.</hi> But the War breaking out not long after this, between the King and <hi>Simon de Montfort,</hi> to whoſe Intereſt the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> was by a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Combination cloſely united, the Grant of the above-mentioned King was made ineffectual, and not the leaſt Symptoms of the intended Wall are at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant viſible.</p>
               <p>In the year 1263. the War growing hot between <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Simon de Montfort,</hi> the King ſets down before <hi>Tunbridge-caſtle,</hi> and forces it to ſnrrender to diſcretion; and therein found, amongſt others, the Counteſs of <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> From whence I collect, that in thoſe Times it was eſteemed, if not the only, yet at leaſt a principal Manſion, of thoſe great Lords of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, there was a Summons iſſued forth by <hi>Hugh de Bigod</hi> Earl of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and Governour of the Hundred of <hi>Hoo,</hi> to injoyn <hi>Richard de Clare</hi> Earl of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> to appear before him to aſſoil himſelf from ſuch Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, as ſhould be objected againſt him, which principally had an Aſpect upon the War waged by him and <hi>Simon Montfort</hi> againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the third. To which he alleadged in his Defence, that he ought not to anſwer, but before the Kings Juſtices of <hi>Eyre;</hi> upon which a Commiſſion was iſſued out, in the third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, to heare and decide the Controverſie, and Sir <hi>Stephen de Pencheſter,</hi> and <hi>John de Rigate,</hi> were the two Juſtices appointed by the King for the final determination of it: and they upon a ſerious winnowing of the whole Matter in Debate, did abſolve the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> from the Crimes with which he had been unjuſtly beſpattered; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe as to the principal part of them, they had been before entombed in the pacification of <hi>Killingworth,</hi> made in the fiftieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</p>
               <p>After this, I cannot find by that ancient Manuſcript, they ſtyle the Chronicle of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> that there was any ſignal Action commenced at this place, becauſe the Caſtle with all its perquiſites, not long after by the Heir of <hi>Audley,</hi> coming into the poſſeſſion of <hi>Stafford,</hi> they planted themſelves at <hi>Stafford-caſtle,</hi> their principal reſidence; and ſo this Fortreſs being neglected and deſerted, languiſhed away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly into decay and ruine: only in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, I find that upon an Inquiſition or Survey of the Priviledges of the Earls of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> as they were Lords of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> it was concluded that the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do within the <hi>Lowy</hi> or <hi>League:</hi> That the Earl had Return of Writs, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of certain Officers, an eſpecial Seſſions in <hi>Eyre;</hi> all which by Intermiſſion are ſhrunk long ſince into diſuſe.</p>
               <p>In the year 1264. to allay all emergent Controverſie for the future; <hi>Boniface</hi> the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> decreed that there ſhould be a Perambulation made concerning their reſpective Bounds: and it was not long after likewiſe concluded between the patties aboveſaid, that Earl <hi>Richard</hi> ſhould hold his Mannor of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and other Lands of the Arch-biſhop by the Service of four Knights Fees, and to be high Steward, and high Butler, which Office was likewiſe to be tranſmitted to his Succeſſors, at the Feaſt of the Arch-biſhops Inthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization, taking for their Service in the Stewardſhip, ſeven competent Robes of Scarlet, thirty Gallons of Wine, thirty pound of Wax for his Lights, Livery of Hay and Oats to feed fourſcore Horſe for two Nights, the Diſhes and Salt which ſhould ſtand before the Arch-biſhop in that Feaſt; and at their departure, the Diet of three Dayes at the Sole Expence of the Arch-biſhop, at four of their Mannors, in any of the four Quarters of <hi>Kent,</hi> whereſoever they pleaſed to fix <hi>ad minuendum ſanguinem;</hi> ſo they repaired thither with fifty Horſes only. To his Office of chief Butlerſhip was allotted ſeven Robes like the former, twenty Gallons of Wine, fifty pound of Wax for furniſhing out of Lights, Livery for ſixty Horſe for two Nights, the Cup wherewith the Arch-biſhop ſhould be ſerved, all the empty Hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads of Beer, and for ſix Tun of Wine, ſo many as ſhould be drunk under the Bar alſo. The Articles of which Compoſition in Times ſubſequent to this Compact, were punctually performed between the Succeſſors of either Party.</p>

               <p>Firſt, in the year 1295. between <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and <hi>Robert Winchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey;</hi> next, between the ſaid Earl, and Arch-biſhop <hi>Reynolds;</hi> then between <hi>Hugh Audley</hi> the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and the Arch-biſhop <hi>John Stratford;</hi> after that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Hugh Stafford</hi> Earl of <hi>Stafford,</hi> to whom the Caſtle and Mannor of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> did devolve in right of the Heir General of <hi>Audley,</hi> and <hi>Simon Sudbury;</hi> and laſtly, between <hi>William Warham</hi> the Arch-biſhop, and <hi>Edward Stafford</hi> the laſt Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> of that Name, in whoſe untimely Sepulcher theſe two great Offices found their final Enterment, and he executed the Stewardſhip in his own perſon, and the Butlerſhip by his deputed Delegate Sir <hi>Thomas Bourchier</hi> Knight.</p>
               <p>The Priory of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> was founded by <hi>Richard de Clare,</hi> in the year of <hi>Grace</hi> 1191. and ſtored with Canons Regular, or Canons of St. <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> and dedicated to St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> which upon the Petition of the Founder, was confirmed by Pope <hi>Celestin,</hi> in the ſame year it was erected.</p>
               <p>In the year 1353. an unhappy Fire ſeiſed upon it, which almoſt reduced the whole Structure into Aſhes: to ballance which Dyſaſter, the Church of <hi>Leigh</hi> was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to this Covent, that by this additional ſupport, this Cloiſter thus defaced with Flame might again recover its former, not only Bulk, but Splendor like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Somerhill</hi> is now an eminent Seat in this Pariſh, and was certainly in elder Times allotted, as a Manſion, or place of Reſidence by the Earls of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> to thoſe Gentlemen who were Bailiffs of their great Chaſe called <hi>South-Frith,</hi> one of whom was <hi>Richard de Philpot</hi> of <hi>Philpots</hi> in <hi>Leigh,</hi> not far diſtant, who flouriſhed here, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and is written in an old Deed, <hi>Balivus Forestae de Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge ſub Ricardo Comite de Clare.</hi> After him I find, one <hi>Nicholas Charles</hi> exerciſed this Office, and flouriſhed in it, in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond: and when he went out, divers of the Family of <hi>Colepeper</hi> and <hi>Vane,</hi> who were Lords of much Land here about <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> were ſucceſſively inveſted in it, whoſe Names it would be too tedious and impertinent to enumerate. But to return: That this Seat was anciently deſtined and devoted to the Uſes above recited, is very probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſituated on the Verge and exterior Margent of the Forreſt, and ſo by its commodious poſition, had a peculiar Aſpect upon thoſe Affairs, wherein this Chaſe and its Juriſdiction was concerned. In fine, after it had been ſubſervient and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial for many hundred years to the ſucceſſive Signory of the ſeveral Families of <hi>Clare, Audley,</hi> and <hi>Stafford,</hi> it was in the thirteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, by that infortunate perſon <hi>Edward Stafford</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who was cruſhed into an heap of Ruines, by thoſe dark and black Engins, which Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> that ſubtle Artificer of Miſchief, had raiſed upon him, was with much other Land forfeited to the Crown, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> about the middle of her reign, by Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion made it the Demeaſne of her faithful Servant Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham,</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Secretary of Eſtate, who dying without Iſſue-male, left it to his Daughter and Heir <hi>Frances,</hi> who was firſt matched to the Invaluable Sir <hi>Philip Sidney;</hi> ſecondly, to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and thirdly, to <hi>Richard Burgh</hi> Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> created Earl of St. <hi>Albans, Auguſt</hi> the twenty third, in the year 1628. to whoſe Son <hi>

                  <hi>Hilden</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and was, as high as I can track any Record, the poſſeſſion of the Noble Family of <hi>Vane,</hi> who are written in very old Deeds, <hi>A Vane,</hi> and was certainly their ancient Seat; before, by matching with the Heir of <hi>Stidolfe,</hi> they became poſſeſſors of <hi>Badſell.

He was the Son of <hi>John A Vane,</hi> who flouriſhed at this place, in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third: but his Predeceſſors enjoyed it, as appears by Original Evidences, many years before. From <hi>Henry Vane</hi> it came over to <hi>John a Vane,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>John Vane,</hi> in the tenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, conveyed it by Sale to <hi>Dixon,</hi> deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded originally from the <hi>Dixons</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Gentlemen of no deſpicable Account in that Nation, and in their poſſeſſion hath it, ever ſince the firſt purchaſe, been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſetled.</p>

                  <hi>Bardens</hi> and <hi>Hadloe</hi> are two little Mannors in <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> both which had Owners of that Sirname. <hi>John de Barden</hi> held the firſt, as the Book of <hi>Aide</hi> informs us, and paid reſpective <hi>Aide</hi> for it, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third: and the dateleſs Evidences relating to <hi>Hadloe,</hi> do aſſure us both of the Antiquity and Truth of the ſecond.

Raefe de St. Leger</hi> is regiſtred in the Roll of thoſe <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Gentlemen, who accompanied <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt to the Siege of <hi>Acon,</hi> and, as the Inſcription on his Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Shroud in the Vault of this Church does ſignifie, was engaged in the Holy Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel fifteen years. Another <hi>Rafe St. Leger,</hi> and <hi>Hugh St. Leger</hi> were <hi>Recognitores magnae Aſſiſae</hi> in the ſecond year of K. <hi>John.</hi> Sir <hi>Rafe de St. Leger,</hi> Sir <hi>Jo. de St. Leger,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho.

Indeed in times ſubſequent to this there was ſcarſe almoſt any noble and generous undertaking, but the Annals of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory repreſent a <hi>St. Leger</hi> concerned and intereſſed in it. And for their Collateral Alliances by which they became knit in Conſanguinitie to ſeveral illuſtrious Families, none in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular have been more Succeſſeful then themſelves: Sir <hi>Thomas St. Leger</hi> ſecond Brother to Sir <hi>Rafe St. Leger</hi> married <hi>Anne Dutcheſſe</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> Siſter to King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and ſo became twiſted into the Family of that Prince, by a Nearneſs of Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as he had before been taken into his Boſome by a union of Friendſhip, by whom he had only <hi>Ann</hi> his Daughter and Heir, who was wedded to Sir <hi>George Manners</hi> L. <hi>Roſſe;</hi> from whom the Earls of <hi>Rutland</hi> are in a direct Line branched out: Sir <hi>James St. Leger</hi> this mans Brother matched with <hi>Anne</hi> one of the Co-heirs of <hi>Thomas Boteler</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond;</hi> from whom the <hi>St. Legers</hi> of the County of <hi>Devon</hi> were extracted; out of which Stem was Sir <hi>William St. Leger,</hi> who was Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred forty and two: Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leger</hi> Father of Sir <hi>Warham,</hi> was Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which place he managed with much of Prudence and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity; his ſecond Son Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leger</hi> Father to Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leger</hi> now of <hi>Wierton</hi> Houſe in <hi>Boughton Monchenſie,</hi> died Maſter of the Rolls in <hi>Ireland;</hi> which Office he diſcharged with a great deal of Faith and no leſs integrity; Thus have I in
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:103337:182"/>Landskip pourtraied this noble Family, which in an undivided Chain of Deſcent was ſetled at <hi>Ulcomb</hi> from the Conquerour's Time even till of late, and then Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leger</hi> alienated his right in it, which was grown reverend by a preſcription of ſo many Ages, to Serjeant <hi>Clerk</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> Father to Mr. <hi>Francis Clerk,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Henry Clerk,</hi> who was ſecond Brother to Sir <hi>John Clerk,</hi> who took the Duke of <hi>Longuevil</hi> priſoner at the Battle fought between Bomy and Spours.</p>

                  <hi>Waltham</hi> (in the Hundreds of <hi>Bredge, Petham,</hi> and <hi>Stowting</hi>) was anciently a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that Revenue; which acknowledged the Intereſs of the Knights Templers, as appears by a Survey taken of this Mannor, in the year of <hi>Grace,</hi> one thouſand one hundred and eighty, and regiſtred in the Book ſtyled <hi>de Terris Templariorum,</hi> which is preſerved in the Remembrancers Office in the Exchequer: and in that Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, there is mention made of <hi>Ivo de Haut,</hi> who held Lands at that Time of <hi>Temple Waltham,</hi> lying at <hi>Petham</hi> not far diſtant, which juſtifies the Antiquity of that Name in this Track.

                  <hi>Whetacre</hi> is another ſmall Mannor, that lies within the Circle of this Pariſh, not worth the memorial, were it not for a Family which extracted its Sirname from hence; for I find <hi>Nigellus de Whetacre</hi> mentioned in the Book of <hi>Aide,</hi> to have held Lands here, in the twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third: In Times of a lower Date, that is, about the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, I find the Family of <hi>Hels</hi> or <hi>Hils,</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from the <hi>Hels</hi> of <hi>Hels-court</hi> in <hi>Woditon</hi> to be planted in the poſſeſſion: and in this Name was the Intereſt of it conſtant, until the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and then it was alienated to <hi>Prude,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor couveyed it to Alderman <hi>Cockain</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> from whom the ſame Stream of Viciſſitude carried it into <hi>Beacon.</hi>

                  <hi>Watringbury</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Twiford,</hi> was, in Ages of a very high Gradation, the Patrimony of a Family which enjoyed that Sirname, and held not only the Mannor of <hi>Watringbury</hi> it ſelf: but <hi>Chart</hi> and <hi>Fowls,</hi> which lie within the Precincts of this Pariſh likewiſe; and bore for their Coat-Armous <hi>Argent ſix Lionceux Rampant Sables:</hi> in aſſimilation, I believe, of the Lord <hi>Leybourne</hi> his Neighbour, who was a Perſon of a vaſt power, and no leſs Eſtate in this Track: but before the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, this Family was extinguiſhed and vaniſhed, and then the next Family which
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:103337:184"/>ſtept into the poſſeſſion of theſe places, upon the extinction of this, was the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Family of <hi>Leybourne</hi> of <hi>Leybourne-caſtle.

               <p>I had almoſt forgot to inform the Reader, that in the fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Henry de Leybourne,</hi> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tringbury;</hi> amongſt which <hi>Chart</hi> in this Pariſh is particularly recited.</p>

                  <hi>Weſtbery</hi> is another Mannor in this Pariſh, which had anciently proprietaries of that Sirname; the laſt of which Name was <hi>Iohn Weſtbery,</hi> who deceaſed without Iſſue, and ſo tranſmitted his Right in it by Teſtament to <hi>Agnes Ellis</hi> his Neece, and ſhe in the twenty third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, alienated her Intereſs in it to <hi>Richard Fiſhbourne,</hi> in whom it was not long reſident; for he in the thirty third year of that Prince, conveyed it by Sale to Sir <hi>Thomas Browne</hi> of <hi>Bechworth-castle</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> Controller of the Houſe, and Privy Councellor to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth; from whom by an even Stream of Deſcent the Title flowed down to his Succeſſor Sir <hi>Thomas Browne,</hi> who in the twenty fifth year of Queen <hi>Elizazeth,</hi> paſſed it away to <hi>Roger Twiſden</hi> Eſquire, Grand-father to Sir <hi>Roger Twiſden</hi> Knight and Baronet, in whom the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent proprietie of this place is reſident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canons</hi> is the laſt Mannor in this Pariſh.

               <p>
                  <hi>Watringbury</hi> had the Grant of a weekly Market on the Tueſday, and a three dayes Fair at the Feaſt of St. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> both procured to it by <hi>Hugh de Leybourne,</hi> in the fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond.</p>

                  <hi>Eaſt-Well</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Wye,</hi> was anciently the poſſeſſion of a Family, which extracted its Sirname from hence, <hi>Matilda de Eaſtwell</hi> held it at her Deceaſe, which was in the fifty ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Rot.

But ſoon after this, this Family was faded away at this place, and then it devolved to be a Limbe of that Revenue, which acknowledged the Juriſdiction and poſſeſſion of <hi>Bertram de Crioll,</hi> and he held it, in the twenty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt: but his Son <hi>John Crioll</hi> dying without Iſſue, about the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, it came down to <hi>Richard de Rokeſley,</hi> Seneſchall and Governour of <hi>Ponthieu</hi> and <hi>Monſtreul,</hi> as appears, <hi>Pat.</hi> 1. <hi>Edwardi ſecundi,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, who had married <hi>Joan</hi> Sole Daughter, and now Heir of <hi>Bertram de Crioll:</hi> but the ſame Viciſſitude, not long after carried it off from this Name; for he went out likewiſe in two Daughters and Co-heirs, one of whom called <hi>Agnes,</hi> by matching with <hi>Thomas de Poynings</hi> emtombed the Name in his Family, and the Eſtate here at <hi>Eaſt-well,</hi> and elſe-where, in his Patrimony: but (as one ingeniouſly obſerves) the World it ſelf, is but a great Ball caſt down into the Aire to ſport the Stars, and all the depopulations of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and ruine of Empires, is but their paſtime; ſo I may likewiſe infer, that great Families, from their tumblings and rollings, are but the mockery and diſports of Time, and ſo it appeared here; for <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Poynings,</hi> Succeſſor to the aboveſaid <hi>Thomas,</hi> died the eleventh year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and left his Eſtate here to his Sole Daughter and Heir, <hi>Eleanor</hi> matched to <hi>Henry Percy</hi> Earl of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland,</hi> in whoſe right he became Lord <hi>Poynings,</hi> and ſo <hi>Eaſtwell</hi> became linked to his Revenue, and dwelt in this Name, and ſupported the Signory of <hi>Percy,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Fate of Sale diſſodged it; for in the twenty third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> paſſes it away to Sir <hi>Thomas Cheyney, William Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>William Fitz Williams,</hi> and they not long after conveyed it to Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hales,</hi> Attorney General to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and he died poſſeſt of it, in the thirty third year of that Prince, and left it to his Son Sir <hi>James Hales,</hi> who not long after alienated it to Sir <hi>Thomas Moile,</hi> Chancellour of the Court of Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, who erected almoſt all that ſtupendious Fabrick, which now ſo obliges the Eye to Admiration, and left it to Sir <hi>Thomas Finch,</hi> who had married <hi>Katharine</hi> his Daughter and Co-heir, a Gentleman who merited a calmer Fate, and a Nobler Tomb; for after many gallant Archievements performed at <hi>Newhaven</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> he ſuffered Shipwrack in his return to <hi>England,</hi> and left it to his Son Sir <hi>Moile Finch,</hi> who very much inlarged <hi>Eaſtwell-court,</hi> with both ſumptuous elegant and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Additaments, and left it in Dower to his Widow <hi>Elizabeth Finch,</hi> Daughter and Heir of Sir <hi>Thomas Heneage</hi> firſt created Viſcounteſs <hi>Maidſtone</hi> by King <hi>James,</hi> and after Counteſs of <hi>Winchelſey,</hi> in the year 1638. by King <hi>Charles:</hi> from whom both the Honour, and <hi>Eaſt-well</hi> deſcended to her Son <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl <hi>Wenchelſey,</hi> and from him to his Son, the Right Honorable <hi>Heneage Finch</hi> now Earl of <hi>Winchelſey,</hi> and Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Maidſton.</hi>

               <p>Since I am ſo happily engaged to a Diſcourſe of this eminent Family of <hi>Finch,</hi> I ſhall diſcover in Landskip the deep Antiquity of their firſt Extraction. They were originally deſcended from <hi>Henry Fitz-Herbert,</hi> Chamberlain to King <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, who married the Daughter and Heir of Sir <hi>Robert le Corbet,</hi> and had Iſſue by her a Son named <hi>Herbert,</hi> and he was Father to <hi>Herbert Fitz-Herbert,</hi> who by his firſt Wife <hi>Lucy</hi> Daughter and Co-heir of <hi>Milo</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and Lord High Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>England,</hi> had Iſſue a Son named <hi>Peter Fitz-Herbert,</hi> from whom the <hi>Herberts</hi> Earls of <hi>Pembroke</hi> originally iſſued out, and by his ſecond Wife <hi>Matilda</hi> (after his Deeeaſe, remarried to the Lord <hi>Columbers</hi>) he had Iſſue <hi>Matthew Fitz-Herbert,</hi> who was one of the <hi>Magnates</hi> or Barons, at the compiling of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and was one of the powerful Partiſans of King <hi>John,</hi> at the making the accord between that Prince and his Barons, at <hi>Running-Mead,</hi> between <hi>Windſor</hi> and <hi>Stanes;</hi> his Son likewiſe called <hi>Matthew Fitz-Herbert,</hi> was the fourth Baron mentioned in the Roll of that Parliament, which was convened at <hi>Tewksbury.</hi> The alteration of this Name into <hi>Finch,</hi> was about the tenth of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, at which Time <hi>Herbert Fitz-Herbert</hi> purchaſed the Mannor of <hi>Finches</hi> in <hi>Lidde,</hi> of which being entire Lord, as he was not of <hi>Netherfeild,</hi> he aſſumed his Sirname from that, as many other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:103337:185"/>fell in that Age, under the ſame Mutation, and borrowed Sirnames from thoſe places which were wholly under their poſſeſſion and Signory. In the eighth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, there was a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> iſſued out, mentioning that <hi>Herbert Fitz-Herbert,</hi> called <hi>Finch,</hi> was a Ward, in the twenty eighth year of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the firſt, and ſo could not perſonally ſerve with the King in his Wars in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore was releaſed of his Eſcuage for all his Eſtate in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> which together with ſome of the ancient Patrimony, and ſeveral Knights Fees at <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and elſewhere, are not yet departed from this Noble Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Weſtwell</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Calchill,</hi> was confirmed to the Monks of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for a ſupply in their Diet, in the year 1241. But it ſeems they were queſtioned, <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> they poſſeſt this Mannor, and after a Solemn Deciſion, <hi>per patriam,</hi> it is affirmed and atteſted in the Confirmation of the aboveſaid Prince, that it was enſtated upon them by his Predeceſſors, and continued afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably parcel of the Demeaſne of the Cloiſter aboveſaid, until it was reſigned by the Monks of <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> into the Hands of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and ſo it reſted in the Crown, until not many years ſince, it was granted to Sir <hi>Nic. Tuſton</hi> of <hi>Hothfield.</hi> The Parſonage anciently belonged to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> until <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> the Arch-biſhop gave it, in the year 1397. to the Monks of <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church,</hi> to counterpoiſe thoſe vaſt expences which they were to be at in re-erecting the Nave or Body of the Cathedral, (called <hi>Aulam Eccleſiae</hi> by <hi>Eadmerus</hi>) which <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon de Sudbury</hi> plucked down, and had intended that it ſhould like a Phoenix, have roſe more glorious out of its Aſhes: but was intercepted in his Deſign by a ſuddain Death, being beheaded by <hi>Wat Tiler,</hi> and the confluence of his impious and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Complices. This Church thus appropriated, was confirmed to the Monks aboveſaid, in the year 1400. by King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and upon the ſuppreſſion was re-enſtated upon the Dean and Chapiter of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ripley-court</hi> is a Seat of good Antiquity in this Pariſh, and more eminent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it afforded a Sirname to Gentlemen of good Ranke in this Track, of which Number was <hi>Richard de Ripley,</hi> who died ſeiſed of this Mannor, in the thirtieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 91. and in an old Deed is called <hi>Miles Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiſcopi,</hi> that is, he held this Mannor of the Arch-biſhop by Knights Service: but before the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, this Family was vaniſhed, and then the <hi>Brockhuls</hi> and <hi>Idens</hi> ſucceeded in the poſſeſſion: the laſt of which was a Family of great Antiquity, and no leſſe Revenue, about <hi>Iden</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and <hi>Rolvenden</hi> in this County. For in the year 1280. as appears by a Fine levied that year; <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Thomas de Iden,</hi> paſſes away Lands to <hi>John de More.</hi> And of this Family was <hi>Alexander Iden</hi> Eſquire, Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the thirty fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, who in the twenty eighth year of that Prince, ſlew <hi>Jack Cade,</hi> who had borrowed the diſguiſed Perſon of <hi>Mortimer,</hi> excited thereunto, as was the Opinion of thoſe Times, by the Suggeſtions of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> to fathom the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Affections to that man, in the ſtrength of whoſe Title he intended in the future to claim the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diadem. But the Attempts of <hi>Cade</hi> being diſappointed by the formerly infatuated, but now diſenchanted Multitude's deſerting of him, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to riſent his Fraud and Impoſture upon their total Diſſipation, ſhrowded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſome of thoſe Grounds which belonged to <hi>Ripley-court,</hi> and lay not far diſtant from <hi>Hothfeild,</hi> and were then in the Tenure of <hi>VVilliam Iden</hi> Juſtice of the Peace, and Father of the aboveſaid <hi>Alexander:</hi> where being diſcovered, he was by that Worthy Perſon, offered up a Sacrifice to the Juſtice of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth. But I have digreſſed, I now return: After this Seat had for ſo many Deſcents been the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of this Family, and the Cradle and Seminary of many Worthy Perſons, who had been ſubſervient and miniſterial to the Honour and Intereſs of this County, by their Magnanimity and Prudence; it went away from <hi>Iden</hi> by Sale to <hi>Darell;</hi> and <hi>George Darell,</hi> in the laſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, conveyed it to <hi>Baker,</hi> Anceſtor to Mr. ...... <hi>Baker</hi> of <hi>VVindſor,</hi> now proprietary of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diggs-court</hi> is another eminent Seat in this Pariſh, which was the Manſion of the Noble Family of <hi>Diggs</hi> or <hi>Digge,</hi> who promiſcuouſly writ themſelves in elder Times ſometimes of <hi>Barham,</hi> and ſometimes of <hi>VVeſtwell,</hi> as appears by many of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:103337:186"/>Evidences and other Muniments yet extant. In the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, there was one <hi>Adomarus de Digge,</hi> who frequently writ himſelf of <hi>Weſtwell:</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were he that was the Judge, or not, I cannot poſitively aver. In fine, after this place had for many Ages acknowledged the Signory of this Family, it came down to <hi>John Digge,</hi> in whom the Male-line ended; ſo that his Female Heir being wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Henry Aucher,</hi> annexed it to the Revenue of that Family, and from him hath the Title by a Thread of many years, been guided down to Mr. ...... <hi>Aucher.</hi>

It was in Times of elder preſcription the Inheritance of <hi>Huſſie,</hi> who likewiſe was entituled to the poſſeſſion of <hi>Dean-court</hi> in <hi>Wingham,</hi> now the Manſion of the <hi>Oxendens,</hi> by purchaſe from this Family. <hi>Henry Huſſie,</hi> a man of great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as appears by that large Eſtate he was Lord of, both at <hi>Wingham, Lenham, Bough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Malherbe,</hi> and elſewhere, died poſſeſt of this Mannor, in the eighteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Numb.</hi> 36. and from him did it in an even and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided Current glide along in this Name, until the latter end of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was paſſed away by Sale to <hi>Milan,</hi> in which Family the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this place is now reſident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Naſh-court</hi> is the next place in <hi>Weſtwell,</hi> that cals for our Survey; in old Deeds I find a Family that ſometimes writ <hi>At Aſh,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Naſh,</hi> into which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Name reſolved, who were poſſeſſors of it: In Times of a lower Step, that is, in the thirty ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, as appears by the cloſe Roll of that year, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 94. <hi>Alanus de Hanekin</hi> held it: but before the latter end of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, this Family had quitted the poſſeſſion by Sale to <hi>Brockhull</hi> of <hi>Calchill,</hi> and was not long after, that is, about the twelfth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, by <hi>Henry Brockhull,</hi> conveyed to <hi>John Darell</hi> Eſquire, Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and Brother of Sir <hi>William Darell,</hi> under-Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> and in this Name it was permanent, until the laſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and then it went away by Sale to <hi>Sharpe</hi> of <hi>Nin-houſe</hi> in great <hi>Chart,</hi> and hath been now for five Deſcents reſident in that Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beamonſton,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Beamſton,</hi> is partly ſituated in <hi>Weſt-well,</hi> and partly ſpread into <hi>Eaſt-well:</hi> but the greateſt part of the Demeaſne is circumſcribed within the Bounds of this Pariſh. And in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, as appears by the Book of <hi>Aide,</hi> was held by <hi>Thomas at More,</hi> at making the Black Prince Knight. But before the fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, this Family was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; for at the Marriage of <hi>Blanch</hi> that Prince's Daughter, as appears by the Roll of <hi>Blanch</hi> Lands kept in the Exchequer, <hi>John Amias</hi> was poſſeſt of it, and paid reſpective <hi>Aide</hi> for it, as having purchaſed it of <hi>At-More:</hi> and in this Name did it reſide, until the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and then it was conveyed by Sale to <hi>John Moile</hi> Eſquire, Father to Sir <hi>Thomas Moile,</hi> who left this, with much other Land to <hi>Katharine</hi> his Daughter and Co-heir matched to Sir <hi>Thomas Finch,</hi> in Right of which Alliance, it is now devolved to be the Inheritance of his great Grand-child <hi>Hencage Finch</hi> the inſtant Earl of <hi>Winchelſey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perytowne</hi> lies likewiſe within the Limits of <hi>Weſtwell,</hi> and is regiſtered in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of thoſe Lands that <hi>William de Aldon</hi> died poſſeſt of, in the thirty fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; and continued chained to the Inheritance of this Family, until about the twenty ſeventh of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, it was paſſed away with much other other Land to Cardinal <hi>Kempe,</hi> who ſetled it in the twenty eighth year of that Prince, on his newly erected Colledge of <hi>Wye,</hi> and reſted there until the twenty ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then it was reſigned into the Hands of that Prince, and he in the thirty eighth year of his reign, granted it to <hi>Thomas Cawarden</hi> or <hi>Carden</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and he not long after conveyed it by Sale to Sir <hi>John Baker</hi> of <hi>Siſingherſt,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor Sir <hi>John Baker</hi> Baronet, hath this preſent year 1657. alienated it to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel Powell</hi> of <hi>Ewherſt</hi> in <hi>Suſſex</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Woditon</hi> or <hi>Wolton,</hi> is the laſt place of any Note in <hi>Weſtwell:</hi> It was originally par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the Inheritance of a Family called <hi>Wolton</hi> or <hi>Woditon. Ivo de Woditon</hi> held it in the year 1236. and left it to his Son <hi>John de Wolton,</hi> who had Iſſue <hi>Richard de Wodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> or <hi>VVolton,</hi> a man of principal Note, in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, who held both this Mannor, and <hi>VVoditon</hi> by <hi>Berham,</hi> which he held of the Arch-Biſhop
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:103337:186"/>of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by Knights Service at making the Black Prince Knight. And in this Man's Succeſſors did the Propriety conſtantly reſide until the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then ſome part of it was conveyed to <hi>John Hampton,</hi> and he about the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth paſſed it away to <hi>Richard Raſel,</hi> who died poſſeſt of it, as appears by his Will in the twentieth of that Prince; but there was ſome part remained unſold, until <hi>William Wolton</hi> dying 1540, ordered it by his Deed to be paſſed away to Feoffees in Truſt to diſcharge Debts, which accordingly was performed and the Remainder conveyed to <hi>Raſell,</hi> in the Deſcendants of which Name and Family the entire proprietie is at this inſtant remaining.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Werehorne</hi> in the Hundreds of <hi>Ham</hi> and <hi>Blackbourne,</hi> was partly under the Juriſdiction of the Church, and partly under the Signory of temporal and Lay Proprietaries: that Moitie of it which was of ſecular Intereſt, belonged to a Family called <hi>Bedford. Rich. de Bedford</hi> obtained a Grant of a Market to it weekly on the <hi>Tueſday,</hi> and a Fair of three days continuance at the Feaſt of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> as appears <hi>Cart.</hi> 52. <hi>Henrici tertii Memb.</hi> 12, which was renued and confirmed to the aboveſaid Perſon in the eighth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt; and he in the ſeventeenth year of that Prince died poſſeſt of it, as is manifeſt, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 20. But after him it was of no long date in the Tenure of this Family; for in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, I find it in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Hugh de VVindleſore</hi> or <hi>VVindſor;</hi> but was not long chained to their Patrimony neither; for about the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, it was alienated to <hi>Moraunt</hi> of <hi>Moraunts Court,</hi> but about the beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, Sir <hi>Thomas Morant</hi> (Son of <hi>VVilliam Moraunt</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> the twelfth and thirteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, to whom that Prince iſſued out a Mandate, that but one Bell ſhould be rang in any Steeple towards the Sea-Coaſt in <hi>Kent</hi>) determined in a Female Heir, who was matched to <hi>James Peckham</hi> of <hi>Yaldham</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> the third and twelfth of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and was as the private evidences of this Family inform me, originally deſcended from <hi>Hugh de Peckham,</hi> who was Conſtable of the Caſtle of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> under K. <hi>John</hi> in the firſt year of his reign; and he in her right became entituled to that Intereſt <hi>Moraunt</hi> had in this place: and in this Family it remained until thoſe Times which approached near the Confines of our Grand-fathers remembrance, and then it was paſſed away to <hi>Ellis;</hi> from whence in Oppoſition to the other Moitie which was of ſpiritual Concernment it was called <hi>Werehorne Ellis,</hi> and from this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily not many years ſince it was carried off by Sale to <hi>Tufton,</hi> in right of which purchaſe the right honourable <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Thanet</hi> is now inveſted in the poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>The other Moietie which belonged to the Church, was given in the year of <hi>Grace</hi> 1010, by <hi>Elphegus</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to the Monks of <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> and was for the proviſion of their Garments. And if you will diſcover how this was rated in the twentieth year of <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Conquerour, the Record of <hi>Doomſ-day</hi> Book will diſcover: <hi>In Limwarled,</hi> ſays the Note, <hi>&amp; in Hundred de Hamme habent Monachi Sanctae Trinitatis de veſtitu eorum</hi> 1. <hi>Manerium de VVerehorne</hi> 1. <hi>Sulling, &amp; eſt appretiatum LXs.</hi> This Mannor being by the Monks and Prior of the Convent aforeſaid ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred into the Hands of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth in the twenty ninth year of his reign, it lay couched in the Demeaſn of the Crown, until the ſeventh year of K. <hi>James,</hi> and then it was by Grant paſſed away to <hi>Tho. Paget,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Twiſden</hi> who in oppoſition to the other Moity which was of temporal Intereſs, called this, <hi>Werehorn Twiſden:</hi> and they not long after paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Thomas Tufton,</hi> Grand-father to the right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Thanet</hi> the inſtant Poſſeſſor of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tinton</hi> in <hi>VVerehorne</hi> was a Mannor which anciently belonged to the Priory of <hi>Horton</hi> near <hi>Hieth;</hi> but upon the ſuppreſſion all its Demeaſn being annexed to the Crown, this was lodged there until the beginning of K. <hi>James,</hi> and then it was by that Prince conveyed by Grant to Sir <hi>VVilliam Sidley</hi> of the Frierie in <hi>Alresford,</hi> Grand-father to Sir <hi>Charles Sidley</hi> Baronet the preſent Lord of the Fee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Capell</hi> in this Pariſh gave Seat and Sirname to a Family ſo called, whoſe Demeaſn lay ſpread into <hi>Ivie-Church, Linton, Boxley, Horſmonden, Capell</hi> by <hi>Brechley, Capell</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Shepey</hi> and this Pariſh. <hi>John de Capell</hi> flouriſhed here in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who was (as appears by the <hi>Leiger</hi> Book of <hi>Boxley</hi>) an eminent Benefactor to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:103337:187"/>that Covent; and from him deſcended Sir <hi>VVilliam at Capell,</hi> an eminent Knight of this County, in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third and <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, who left it to his Son <hi>Richard at Capell:</hi> and he dying without Iſſue, in the fifteenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, Sir <hi>John Orlanſton</hi> in right of his Wife, who was his Siſter and Co-heir entred upon his Inheritance at this place, and left it to his Son <hi>Richard Orlanſton</hi> Esq; who deceaſed without Iſſue in the ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth: and ſo upon the Diviſion of the Eſtate, <hi>VVilliam Scot</hi> who had eſpouſed <hi>Joan</hi> one of the Siſters and Co-heirs, was planted in the Inheritance of this place; and from whom it is now devolved to be the poſſeſſion of <hi>Edward Scot</hi> of <hi>Scots-Hall</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ham</hi> is another eminent Mannor in this Pariſh which gives Name to the whole Hundred, and was, as high as the Ray of any Intelligence will guide us to diſcover, folded up in the paternal Demeaſn of the ancient Family of <hi>Orlanſton. VVilliam de Orlanſton</hi> obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Lands at <hi>Orlanſton, VVerehorne,</hi> and other places, in the fifty firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and being fenced in with this Immunity, it came along by the Steps of Several Deſcents to <hi>Richard Orlanſton</hi> Son of Sir <hi>John Orlanſton,</hi> who dying without Iſſue in the ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, as is manifeſt, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 16. <hi>Joan</hi> one of his two Siſters matched to <hi>William Scot</hi> of <hi>Scots-Hall;</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> the ſecond, wedded to <hi>William Parker</hi> of <hi>Parkers</hi> in this Pariſh, became his two Co-heirs: and upon breaking the Eſtate by mutual Diviſion into parcels, this in the ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth was annexed to the Patrimony of <hi>Scot,</hi> and from him did the Thread of ſucceſſive Deſcent tranſmit to Mr. <hi>Edward Scot</hi> of <hi>Scots-Hall</hi> Eſquire, who ſtill by paternal right enjoys the Inheritance of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parkers</hi> is another Mannor which next ſummons our remembrance, which afforded a Sirname, as it gave an Habitation to a Family ſo ſtyled. <hi>Edward Parker</hi> held Lands in <hi>Werehore, Weſterham,</hi> and other places at his Deceaſe, which was in the ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, as appears, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 1.14. and in this Name was the Title and Inheritance conſtant until the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and then I find by ſeveral Court-rolls one <hi>John Engham</hi> to be fixed by purchaſe in the poſſeſſion: and in this Family did it remain uninterrupted until the beginning of K. <hi>James,</hi> and then it was by Sale conveyed to <hi>Taylor,</hi> who not long after demiſed it to <hi>Collins;</hi> from whom not long ſince it came by purchaſe to <hi>Squire,</hi> and he not many years ſince paſſed it away to Dr. ...... <hi>Kingſley</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in whoſe Deſcendants the Proprietie of it, is ſtill reſident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hampton Cocleſcombe</hi> is the laſt place conſiderable in <hi>Werehorne;</hi> which gave Name originally to a Family which here had their Habitation, and likewiſe were poſſeſſors of much Land at <hi>Weſtwell,</hi> and other places; and having lived here many Deſcents, the poſſeſſion of this place at laſt devolved to <hi>John Hampton,</hi> who about the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth paſſed it away to <hi>John May</hi> of <hi>Bibrook:</hi> whoſe ſucceſſor <hi>John May</hi> concluding about the latter end in a Daughter and Heir called <hi>Alice</hi> matched to <hi>John Edolph</hi> it came to be the Inheritance of that Family; but did not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Signory of it; for this <hi>John Edolph</hi> deceaſed without Iſſue-male, and left it to his ſole Daughter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> matched to <hi>William Wilcock,</hi> who expiring likewiſe in two Female Heirs, <hi>Martha</hi> matched to <hi>Edward Ratcliff</hi> Doctor of Phyſick, and Phyſitian to Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and K. <hi>James;</hi> and the ſecond matched to <hi>William Andrews,</hi> they divided this Mannor as parcel of his Inheritance. <hi>William Andrews</hi> in the twenty ninth year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> demiſed his proportion to <hi>Rowland Bridges</hi> and <hi>Robert Philipſon.</hi> And <hi>Edward Radcliff</hi> alienated that part of it which accrued to him in the forty third year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to <hi>Edward Rolt</hi> and <hi>Andrew Merſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Weſterham</hi> gives Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is placed, and was in elder Times the patrimony of a Family called <hi>Camville,</hi> which was of ſome eminence in this Track. <hi>William de Camville,</hi> and <hi>G. de Camville</hi> entred <hi>England</hi> with <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Conquerour. <hi>Thomas de Camville</hi> was one of the <hi>Recognitores magnae Aſſiſae</hi> in the ſeventh year of K. <hi>John:</hi> and <hi>Geffrey de Camville</hi> was with <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt at the Siege of <hi>Carlaverock</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> in the twenty eighth year of his reign, and there received the Order of Knighthood, and here this Family concluded: for afterwards I find this Mannor in the Hands of the Abbot of <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> who obtained a Market weekly to be held at this place on the <hi>Munday</hi> and a Fair yearly upon the Vigil, the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:103337:187"/>day, and day after the Nativity of our Lady, as appears, <hi>Pat.</hi> 25. <hi>Edwardi tertii Num.</hi> 32. And here it remained with their revenue, untill the Suppreſſion of that Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; and then being rent away by that Tempeſt, it was in the thirty ſecond year of that Prince, granted to Sir <hi>Iohn Greſham,</hi> which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion was again confirmed to the Lady <hi>Beatrix Greſham,</hi> Widow of Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham</hi> his Son by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> from whom it is now devolved to <hi>Marmaduke Greſham</hi> Esq; the Heir apparent of the Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Broxham</hi> is a place of eminent Account in this Pariſh. <hi>Iohn de Inſula</hi> or <hi>Iſley,</hi> was Lord of this Mannor, and obtained a Charter of Free-warren here, in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond. After the <hi>Iſleys</hi> were gon out, the <hi>Aſhways</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively ſtept into the poſſeſſion. <hi>Stephen de Aſhway</hi> obtained a Licence to incloſe a Park here in the forty firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, the Characters and Reliques of which are not ſo generally demoliſhed and diſparked by Time, but that they are ſtill obvious to a Curious eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet this Priviledge could not fix it long in this Family; for about the latter end of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, I find it by Sale caſt into the poſſeſſion of <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Clinton,</hi> who held it at his Deceaſe, which was in the firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 16. But here likewiſe the Title was as volatile and tranſitory; for about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Clinton</hi> paſſed it away to <hi>Thomas Squerie,</hi> who was Lord of <hi>Squeries-court</hi> in this Pariſh, and was deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from <hi>Iohn de Squerie:</hi> whom I find by ſome old Evidences to have lived at <hi>Weſterham,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and it is poſſible, either erected or very much augmented the Seat called <hi>Squeries-court.</hi> The Arms <hi>viz. a Squirrel brouſing on a Haſell-nut,</hi> are depicted in very ancient coloured Glaſſe in <hi>Weſterham-church:</hi> but this <hi>Thomas</hi> above-mentioned, dying in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, without Iſſue-male, <hi>Margaret</hi> his eldeſt Daughter matched to Sir <hi>William Cromer,</hi> and <hi>Dorothy</hi> his youngeſt, wedded to <hi>Richard Mervin</hi> of <hi>Fontels</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> became his two Coheirs: and upon the diviſion of the eſtate, <hi>Squeries-court</hi> and <hi>Broxham</hi> were annexed to the patrimony of <hi>Cromer,</hi> in which Family they made their aboad until the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; and then <hi>VVilliam Cromer</hi> Eſquire, having by ſome Delinquencie forfeited them to the Crown, that Prince granted them to <hi>Thomas Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden</hi> or <hi>Carden</hi> Eſquire; from which Family about the middle of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign, they went off by Sale to <hi>Beresford,</hi> who almoſt in our memory ſold <hi>Squeries-Court</hi> to Sir <hi>George Stroud,</hi> and he ſome few years ſince, alienated it to <hi>Thomas Lambert</hi> Eſquire, who hath lately demiſed it to Mr...... <hi>Leech:</hi> but <hi>Broxham</hi> was conveyed to Mr. <hi>Tho.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ilſton,</hi> whoſe Grandchild Mr. ..... <hi>Petley</hi> is the Heir apparent of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well-ſtreet</hi> and <hi>Gayſam</hi> in this Pariſh, did anciently confeſs the two Families of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> and <hi>Shelley</hi> for its proprietaries. <hi>William Atwell</hi> held <hi>Wellſtreet,</hi> as appears by an ancient Court-roll, in the thirty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Thomas Shelley</hi> in the forty ſixth year of the ſame Monarch, ſettles <hi>Gayſam</hi> by Teſtament on <hi>Thomas</hi> his Son and Heir, who in the eighth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, conveys it to his Son <hi>Thomas Shelley,</hi> whoſe Deſcendant about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, demiſed it to <hi>John Potter;</hi> and his Succeſſor about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, purchaſed <hi>VVell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet</hi> of the Heirs of <hi>Cothull,</hi> and is in the Liſt of five of this Family who lye bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in <hi>Weſterham-church,</hi> and this Branch of the Name here, was deſcended from <hi>Iohn Potter,</hi> who held Lands at <hi>Dertford</hi> the twelfth of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and whoſe poſterity continued Lords of theſe two places, untill the Beginning of King <hi>James,</hi> and then ...... <hi>Potter</hi> dying without Iſſue-male, his only Daughter and Heir brought them to be the Inheritance of Sir <hi>Iohn Rivers</hi> of <hi>Chafford,</hi> who not many years ſince, demiſed his Intereſt in <hi>Well-ſtreet,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> of <hi>Milk-ſtreet</hi> in <hi>London</hi> Scrivener.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valons</hi> in this Pariſh was formerly the Manſion of a Family called in old dateleſſe Deeds <hi>de Valoniis,</hi> and in Engliſh <hi>Valons:</hi> but the greateſt Honor which accrued to it, was, that <hi>Iſlip</hi> Abbot of <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> bought it in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh of <hi>Caſinghurſt,</hi> a Family which had been poſſeſt of it many Deſcents before, and gave it to his Servant <hi>VVilliam Middleton,</hi> who much improved it with Building. And in his Family it was reſident untill the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then it was conveyed to <hi>James Verſeline</hi> deſcended out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who gave it with his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Anne Verſeline,</hi> to <hi>Peter Manning,</hi> from which Family not many years ſince it
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:103337:188"/>paſſed away to Mr. <hi>Randall Manning</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe Son and Heir Mr. <hi>Thomas Manning</hi> is now in the enjoyment of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Werd</hi> or <hi>Werth</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Eaſtry</hi> is a Pariſh if you conſider it in its precincts, but narrow; if in poſition, low and unhealthful, or, if again in its number of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, not conſiderable; but yet there are two places within the Ambuts and Boundaries of it which claim ſome conſideration. The firſt is the Mannor of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe,</hi> which was anciently the <hi>Perots,</hi> who held this Mannor as the private Deeds of this Name and Family inform me, as high as the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. <hi>Thomas de Perot</hi> died poſſeſt of it in the fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot.

                  <hi>Lidde</hi> in ancient Records written <hi>Hlyden</hi> is a ſecond Mannor in <hi>Werd</hi> of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Account, ever ſince it was given at the Requeſt of <hi>Janibert</hi> the Arch-Biſhop by K. <hi>Offa</hi> in the year 874 to the Monks of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> (as the Records of that Church diſcover to me) under the Notion of three Sullings or Ploughlands. And the Inſtrument which confirmed this Donation, was ſigned with the Marks that is Croſſes of <hi>Offa</hi> the King, <hi>Janibert</hi> the Arch-Biſhop, <hi>Kenedrith</hi> the Queen, three other Biſhops, five other Abbots, Duke <hi>Edbald,</hi> and eleven other principal Perſons or Noblemen. And that this was the manner of Signature in elder Times, that is, the affixing of Croſſes to all publick Inſtruments and other original Donations, is moſt certain; For Sealing came into <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, who being bred up in <hi>Normandy,</hi> in which Province, and in <hi>France</hi> the Uſe of affixing Seals to Deeds had been in Uſe long before his Time, introduced that Cuſtome and way of Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into this Nation, as being more conſpicuous and diſtinguiſhable than that of Croſſes, or thoſe other wayes of confirming of Grants of Land, either to the Church or to ſecular Uſes, which was either <hi>per Collocationem Gladii ſeu Cultelli ſupra Altare,</hi> by the placing or laying a Sword or Knife upon the Altar, whereby thoſe which did make Donations of Land did tacitly inſinuate that their Honour was involved in their Conſcience, or elſe <hi>per Traditionem Surculi vel ſtipitis,</hi> which Cuſtome is yet obſerved in our Copy-hold Land, where Surrenders are made by delivery of a Turfe, Twig, or

But ſealing with Coats of Arms, was not brought in, untill the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, but were borne by perſons of Honor on their Tabards or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats: two Examples of which I have ſeen, one of <hi>William Warren</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> who in the ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, ſealed with the Figure of a <hi>Chivaler on Horſeback;</hi> his Capariſons, Tabard, and Shield, being all <hi>Checquee,</hi> the paternal Coat of this Family; the other was of <hi>Richard Curzon</hi> of <hi>Croxall</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> who in the reign of King <hi>John,</hi> ſtands in a Window pourtrayed in his Surcoat, ſurmounted with a <hi>Bend,</hi> charged with a <hi>Martlet.</hi> And this was done in Imitation of the Heralds, who wore the Arms of thoſe Princes they ſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Indeed Seals in higher Ages, were of that ſacred Eſtimate, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt, they were decryed by the owners, leaſt they might be affixed to any ſurrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Inſtrument, which might prejudice either their Fame or Eſtate. And in the interval of their Abſence or Loſſe, the Owners aboveſaid were accuſtomed to Seal with the Seal of the Biſhop of the Dioceſs, or elſe with that of the next adjacent Abbot, all Deeds and Inſtruments, either of Publick or private Intereſs. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: this Donation of <hi>Offa's,</hi> though thus ſecured and ſtrengthned, could not ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Mannor, from the Rage of ahat Tempeſt, which, in the twenty ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, like a Whirlwind caught it up in the Patrimony of the Church, and drop'd it into the Revenue of the Crown, where it lay untill Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the Beginning of her Raign, paſſed it away by Grant to <hi>William Lovelace</hi> Eſquire, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant at Law, whoſe Son Sir <hi>William Lovelace,</hi> not long after, demiſed it by Sale to Sir <hi>John Smith,</hi> Grand-father to <hi>Philip</hi> Viſcount <hi>Strangford,</hi> who now enjoys it.</p>

In the twentieth year of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, <hi>Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Baion</hi> and Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> held this place of the Gift of his half Brother which was that Prince; and <hi>Trendle Park</hi> adjoyning there, was a Compoſition between the Arch-biſhop and this Man, for certain Land of the ſaid Arch-biſhop, to be incloſed and included within the ſaid Park at <hi>Trendley:</hi> which ſignifies thus much unto us, that <hi>Woodſtock</hi> which boaſts it ſelf, to be the firſt incloſed Park of <hi>England,</hi> was not ſo ancient as this at <hi>Trendley.</hi> In Times of a more modern Character, that is, in thoſe which commence from the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, it acknowledged the <hi>Brewſes</hi> Barons of <hi>Brember</hi> in <hi>Suſſex</hi> to be its proprietaries, who engrafted their own Name upon it, which hath ſprouted out, and flouriſhed upon it untill this Day. <hi>William de Brewoſa</hi> or <hi>de brewe</hi> held it, and was ſeveral times ſummoned to ſit in Parliament as Baron, in the reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and dyed in the ninth year of the laſt Prince, <hi>Rot.

After this Family had deſerted the poſſeſſion, which was about the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, it became the Inheritance of many of the moſt eminent Nobility of this Kingdome. I ſhall repreſent them out of ſome ancient Court-rolls in a Compendious Series. <hi>Edmund Plantagenet</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> held it in the fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. <hi>William Longspey</hi> had it in the the twentieth year of the aboveſaid Prince, and paid an auxiliary ſupply for it at making the Black Prince Knight. <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> dyed ſeiſed of it in the twenty ſixth year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third. <hi>Thomas Holland</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>Joan</hi> his Wife, Siſter and Coheir of the abovementioned Earl, were poſſeſt of it in the thirty fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. <hi>Lucie</hi> Wife of <hi>Edmund Holland</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> was ſeiſed of it in the ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth. After whom it devolved to <hi>Edmund Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> and he held it in the third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth. <hi>Joan</hi> the Wife of Sir <hi>Iohn Grey</hi> one of the Siſters and Coheirs of the aboveſaid <hi>Edmund,</hi> was inveſted in the poſſeſſion in the fourth year of the aboveſaid Prince. Not long after this, it came to own the Signory of the <hi>Tiptofts,</hi> and continued faſtned to their patrimony, until the renth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth. When <hi>Iohn Tiptoft</hi> Earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> being empeached of cloſe Confederacy and Combination with the aboveſaid Prince, then forced into Exile, was by the Parliament then principally moulded out of the Lancaſtrian Faction, attainted and beheaded, and his eſtate here confiſcated to the Crown, and there was lodged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til

For the ſnatching off the Cap or <hi>Pileus</hi> of <hi>Tarquinius Priſcus</hi> by an Eagle, and the placing it on his Head again, was by the <hi>Augurs</hi> interpreted as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his future poſſeſſing the Roman Diadem. When ſlaves received their manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion they were ſaid to be <hi>ad Pileum vocati,</hi> their liberty was demonſtrated to be compleated by putting on a Cap.

                  <hi>Brook place</hi> is the laſt place of eſtimate in this Pariſh, which in elder Times was wrapped up in the Inheritance of <hi>Wenderton,</hi> and having continued many Deſcents interlinked with this Family, the Name and Title found one Sepulcher together for <hi>Jane Wenderton</hi> the Heir General of the Family by matching with <hi>Richard Oxenden</hi> Gentleman fixed it in his Inheritance, and he much enhaunſed this ancient Seat with Additional Improvements, and from him the Right of Deſcent hath now made it the Patrimony of Mr. <hi>Henry Oxenden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whitſtaple</hi> gives Name to the whole Hundred which ſurrounds it, and was a Branch of that ample Patrimony, which encreaſed the Revenue of <hi>Alex. de Baliol,</hi> E. of <hi>Atholl,</hi> and he held this and a place called <hi>Grafton</hi> in this Pariſh, as likewiſe a wood called <hi>Northwood</hi> not farre diſtant, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and left it to his Son and Heir <hi>John Earl</hi> of <hi>Athol,</hi> who having with an unſucceſsful zeal endeavoured to ſupport the ſinking Intereſt of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt the violent Eruptions of <hi>Edw.</hi> the firſt, which like an impetuous Inundation, ſought to bear down all the Glory of that Nation, into an irrecoverable Ruine, was in an infortunate Encounter made Captive by that Prince, and being attainted of high Treaſon, and Executed, his Eſtate here by Eſcheat devolved to the Crown, and was by <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, in the ninth of his reign granted to <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Lord <hi>Badeleſmere:</hi> but he having again loſt it by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt and Defection in the ſixteenth and ſeventeenth years of that Prince, it revolved to the Crown and continued there, until K. <hi>Edward</hi> the third in the ſecond year of his Reign reſtored it to <hi>Bartholomew de Badeleſmer</hi> his Son, who died in the twelfth year of the aboveſaid Prince, and left it to his Brother <hi>Giles de Badeleſmer,</hi> and he deceaſing
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:103337:190"/>without Iſſue it accrued by <hi>Mawde</hi> one of his Siſters and Coheirs to be the Inheritance of <hi>John Vere</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and he held it at his Death, which was in the thirty fourth year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, and to this Family it remained by the Links of many Deſcents ſucceſſively faſtned, until at laſt that Revolution which is made by Sale caſt it into the poſſeſſion of <hi>Phineux;</hi> the laſt of which who enjoyed it was <hi>John Phineux</hi> Eſquire, who concluded in a Daughter and Heir called <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who by matching with Sir <hi>John Smith</hi> of <hi>Oſtenhanger,</hi> knit it to his Eſtate, from whom by the Devolution of Deſcent it is now come to confeſs for proprietary the right honourable <hi>Philip</hi> Viſcount <hi>Strangford</hi> his Grand-child.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is <hi>Cheſtfield,</hi> which was the Manſion of a Family which bore that Sirname, and although I can trace none higher by any publick Record then <hi>James Cheſtfield,</hi> who paid reſpective Aid for it at the making the Black Prince Knight, as is manifeſt by the Book of <hi>Aid</hi> collected in the twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, yet it is upon poſſible Conjectures to be argued that they were farre more ancient here, becauſe they aſſumed their Denomination from this Seat; from <hi>Cheſtfield</hi> about the latter end of the Government of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, it came over by purchaſe to <hi>Henry Reyner;</hi> but whether he iſſued from <hi>Borden,</hi> or the <hi>Reyners</hi> of <hi>Borden</hi> from him, I cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; but it is very probable he determined in four Daughters and Coheirs matched to <hi>Edmund Meade, Jo. Badkin, John Reynolds,</hi> and <hi>John Springate,</hi> who concurred in one united Conſent, and by one common conveyance demiſed their Intereſt in it to <hi>John Roper</hi> of St. <hi>Dunſtans;</hi> from whom <hi>Edward Roper</hi> Eſquire, now of <hi>Well-hall</hi> in <hi>Eltham,</hi> claims the inſtaut Demeaſn and Signory of it.</p>
               <p>The third is <hi>Grimgill</hi> ſo vulgarly called, but originally and more properly <hi>Greenſhield,</hi> for ſo it is in Records of an elder Aſpect alwayes written. It was the Seat of a Family that was known by that Appellation, and although the Breviat of the private Evidences which relate to it, diſcover to us owners of the Name no higher then <hi>John Greenſhield,</hi> who flouriſhed here about the entrance into the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and who was Father to <hi>Henry Greenſhield,</hi> whoſe Will is Regiſtred at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and which bears Date from the laſt of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth; yet it is more then probable that they were eminent here long before, becauſe the above-recited <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Henry Greenſhields,</hi> were Lords of no deſpicable or narrow fortune not onely here, but about <hi>Sandwich</hi> and <hi>Wodnesborough</hi> likewiſe; from <hi>Greenſhield</hi> by ſale the propriety paſſed over to <hi>Quekes</hi> of <hi>Quekes</hi> in <hi>Birchington,</hi> who ſuddenly after being extinguiſhed in a Daughter and Heir, all his Intereſt in <hi>Grimgill,</hi> was with her tranſported in Marriage to <hi>Criſpe,</hi> originally extracted out of the County of <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Criſpe</hi> Eſquire held his Shrievalty here, which was in the ſecond year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> from <hi>Criſpe</hi> it was by purchaſe conveyed into the Revenue of <hi>Paramour,</hi> where after it had for ſeveral years been fixed, it was very lately taken off from this Family, and by Sale made the Poſſeſſion of Mr. <hi>Twiman</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, here was <hi>Condies-place</hi> which was the Reſidence of <hi>John Condie,</hi> who had in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third contracted upon himſelf, (which is yet indelibly fixed upon his Memory) a Character of high Account, becauſe he had made an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Enemie of the Kings Captive <hi>in Congreſſu Bellico,</hi> thoſe are the words of the Record in a perſonal Combat; for which he had thirty pound <hi>per Annum</hi> ſetled upon him out of the Kings Profits of the <hi>Staple</hi> at <hi>Canterbury</hi> by Charter or Grant from <hi>Edward</hi> the third dated the ſeventh day of <hi>July</hi> in the fourteenth year of his reign. Now if you will know, where this memorable Action was commenced, the ſame Record will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that the Scene of it was laid at <hi>Swine</hi> in <hi>Normandy:</hi> But to proceed: this Man not long after he was thus adorned with theſe Tophies of Honour, paid that Debt to Nature, which we all owe, and left <hi>Condies Hall</hi> to his Son <hi>William Condy,</hi> who dying without any lawful Iſſue, <hi>Margaret Condy</hi> one of his Siſters became his Co-heir, who by her eſpouſals with <hi>Robert Grubbe</hi> made <hi>Condies Hall</hi> parcel of his Demeaſn; but he likewiſe in the Age ſubſequent to this determining in Females, <hi>Agnes</hi> one of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs being wedded to <hi>John Iſaack</hi> of <hi>Blackmanbery</hi> in <hi>Bridge,</hi> did much ſwell and improve his Patrimony, with that Additional Eſtate ſhe united to his, and here in this Name was the poſſeſſion for ſundry Deſcents reſident, even till our Fathers Memory. But here for want of Intelligence, I can proceed no farther; and indeed the Place being fallen from its original Name by Diſuſe, and that Repute it was under, when it was
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:103337:191"/>poſſeſt by ſo noble proprietaries, is now onely fit to find the Common Sepulcher of Oblivion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wicheling</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Eyhorne,</hi> was folded up in the Patrimony of the noble Family of <hi>Cobham</hi> of <hi>Sterborough</hi> iſſued out f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om the <hi>Cobhams</hi> of <hi>Cobham Hall,</hi> and of this Family was <hi>Reginald de Cobham,</hi> who was frequently ſummoned to ſit in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as Baron, in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and from this worthy perſon did this Mannor by ſucceſſive Devolution come down to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> of <hi>Sterborough,</hi> who deceaſed in the eleventh of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and left his Eſtate here and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to <hi>Anne</hi> his ſole Daughter and Heir marched to <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Borough</hi> called to ſit in Parliament as Baron of <hi>Sterborough</hi> and <hi>Gainsborough,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and from him both the Title of Baron and of this Mannor flowed down ſucceſſively to his Grandchild <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Borough,</hi> who paſſed away the Inheritance to <hi>Edward Filmer</hi> Eſquire, whoſe Grand-child Sir <hi>Edward Filmer</hi> in relation to that purchaſe, challenges the inſtant right and revenue of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Willesborough</hi> in the Hundreds of <hi>Chart</hi> and <hi>Longbridge</hi> has nothing to make it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable but that it was a principal piece of that revenue which in this County related to the noble and ancient Family of <hi>Brent;</hi> of which was <hi>Falcatius de Brent,</hi> a man whom our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory pencils out to us under a Character of the moſt perfect Courage and Magnanimity, though diſordered with ſome wild Sallies and Exceſſes: which peradventure may be attributed to the Evaporations of youth, which is alwayes volatile and airy, rather then to any ſetled and contracted Habit of vitious Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and mutinous paſſions which was lodged within Him. But to proceed: when <hi>Willesborough</hi> had by a ſucceſſive thread of many Ages been guided along through ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deſcents down to <hi>John Brent,</hi> he died and left <hi>John Brent</hi> his Heir, who expiring without Iſſue, <hi>Margaret</hi> his eldeſt Siſter became the Inheritrix of all his poſſeſſions, and ſhe being matched with <hi>John Dering</hi> Eſquire of <hi>Surrenden Dering,</hi> this place by Female right became tranſplanted into the Patrimony of that Name and Family, and Sir <hi>Edward Dering</hi> about the year 1635, conveyed it to <hi>Robert Scot</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> Eſquire, whoſe Son and Heir <hi>Thomas Scot</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> Eſquire is now proprietary of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wilmington</hi> in Hundred of <hi>Dartford</hi> reſolves it ſelf into two Mannors which exact a peculiar Cogniſance, and the firſt is <hi>Rue Hill</hi> (ſo it was anciently written though now by vulgar Acceptation it is called <hi>Rowe Hill.</hi>) It was in Ages of a higher Track, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of an illuſtrious and generous Family called <hi>Giſe,</hi> who were in thoſe times as eminent for the largeneſs of their poſſeſſions, as they were for the Antiquity of their Extraction; and from hence were the <hi>Giſes</hi> of the Counties of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter</hi> originally ſprouted out. <hi>Anſelmus de Giſe</hi> had a Charter of Free Warren granted to his Lands at <hi>Rue Hill</hi> in <hi>Wilmington,</hi> in the twenty ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt; but it appears the Poſſeſſion of this place, inveſted and fortified with this Grant was not long after united to this Family; for <hi>John Giſe</hi> this mans Grand-child ſold it to <hi>Nicholas Brember,</hi> who in the twelfth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, being blaſted with an impeachment of high Treaſon, fell an Oblation to the fury of thoſe Lords, who upon pretence of aſſerting the publick Liberty, ſought to fetter up the majeſty and prerogative of their Prince, within thoſe narrow Reſtraints, and Limits which they preſcribed to empale it in, and pare off the power of the Crown (which like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Locks being ſhaved Kings remain like other men.) Upon his attaint <hi>Rue Hill</hi> reſolved into the revenue of the Crown, and King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond in the fourteenth year of his reign granted it to <hi>Adam Bamme</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and in his Lineage was the Inheritance of it ſundry Generations wrapt up, till in our Grand-fathers memory it was alienated to <hi>Brett;</hi> from whoſe ſucceſſor the ſame Alteration rowled the poſſeſſion not many years ſince into <hi>Smith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is <hi>Highlands</hi> which was parcel of the Demeaſn of the Knights of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and upon the Diſſolution of their Alberge here in <hi>England,</hi> was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about the thirty fifth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth to Sir <hi>Thomas Moile,</hi> and Sir <hi>Maurice Dennis;</hi> the laſt of which paſſed away his Concernment in it to Sir <hi>Thomas Moile</hi> by whoſe Daughter and Co-heir called <hi>Amy Moile,</hi> it came to be poſſeſt by
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:103337:191"/>Sir <hi>Thomas Kempe;</hi> who left it to his Son and Heir Sir <hi>Thomas Kempe</hi> who conveyed it to his Brother Mr. <hi>Reginald Kempe,</hi> who in our Fathers memory paſſed it away to <hi>Lancelot Bathurſt</hi> Eſquire, Father to Sir <hi>Edward Bathurſt,</hi> who is the inſtant proprietary of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wodnesborough</hi> lies in the Hundred of <hi>Eaſtrie,</hi> and ſpreads it ſelf into many places of no deſpicable Account. Firſt there is <hi>Shelving,</hi> which was as high as any Evidence, can waft us to diſcover, the Demeaſn of <hi>Houghham</hi> of <hi>Hougham</hi> by <hi>Dover,</hi> a Family rooted in as deep Antiquity as any in this Track. <hi>Robert de Hougham</hi> is enrolled in an ancient Regiſter of thoſe <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Gentlemen, who ſupported the cauſe and Quarrel of <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt at the Seige of <hi>Acon.</hi> Sir <hi>Robert de Hougham</hi> his Son died poſſeſt of it in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and left <hi>Robert Hougham</hi> his Heir, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in Daughters and Co-heirs; ſo that <hi>Benedicta Houghham</hi> one of them being married to <hi>John Shelving,</hi> this became his Demeaſn, where he erected a Houſe, upon which he fixed his Sirname, and called it <hi>Shelving,</hi> which in thoſe Times was of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Repute, though ſince by the frequent impreſſions of Age, it is ſhrunk into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and Obſcurity, from <hi>Shelving</hi> one Moitie of it by Sale was tranſmitted to <hi>St. Leger,</hi> and ſo continued diſtinguiſhed in the Intereſt of it, till both <hi>Shelving</hi> and <hi>St. Leger</hi> did by a mutual Concurrence paſs away their joynt right in it to <hi>Dynley:</hi> where it had not long been Seated, but the like Fatality transferred the Poſſeſſion of it to <hi>White;</hi> and here the Title of it was as unfixt and unſtable alſo: for from this Family by purchaſe it was carried into the Revenue of <hi>Knight,</hi> who in our memory altered his Intereſt in it by Sale to Mr. <hi>Solomon Hougham</hi> of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> primitively iſſued out in a Collateral Line from Sir <hi>Robert Hougham,</hi> upon whoſe late Deceaſe his Son and Heir Mr. <hi>Richard Hougham</hi> is now poſſeſſor of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ringleton</hi> does ſecondly exact ſome Remembrance: It was anciently the Intereſt of <hi>Perot;</hi> for <hi>Thomas Perot</hi> held it at his Death, which was in the fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; but when this Name was extinguiſhed in a Daughter and Heir, <hi>William Langley</hi> by matching with Her entituled himſelf to the Poſſeſſion of this place, in which Family the Inheritance for ſundry Generations was ſettled, till the Viciſſitude of Time by Sale conveyed it into the Demeaſn of <hi>John White,</hi> who was originally a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of the <hi>Staple,</hi> and did by ſeveral Acts of exemplary Munificence, evidence him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a liberal Benefactor to <hi>Canterbury.</hi> But long it was not faſtned to the Poſſeſſion of this Name; for his Succeſſor alienated it to <hi>Butler</hi> of <hi>Heronden</hi> in <hi>Eaſtrie,</hi> from which Family <hi>Ringleton</hi> by the ſame Mutation was brought to own the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Neame,</hi> and his Son <hi>Daniel Neame</hi> ſold it to <hi>Spencer</hi> of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor <hi>Nicholas Spencer</hi> dying without Iſſue, his Siſter who was wedded to <hi>Hughs</hi> deſcended from <hi>Hughs</hi> of <hi>Middleton Stony</hi> in the County of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who was branched out from the <hi>Hughs</hi> of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> by a Relative right deduced from that Alliance, has planted the preſent Poſſeſſion in the Patrimony of that Name and Family.</p>
               <p>Thirdly upper <hi>Hamwold</hi> may fall under a Diſquiſition, becauſe it was wound up in the Eſtate and Propriety of <hi>Greenſhield,</hi> whoſe principal reſidence was at <hi>Greenſhield</hi> in <hi>Whitſtaple,</hi> corruptly called <hi>Grimgil,</hi> where I have ſpoken more largely of this Family: onely this I ſhall add, that <hi>Henry Greenſhield,</hi> who died in the laſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, was a munificent Benefactor to the poor and other indigent and neceſſitous people of the Town of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> to whom he bequeaths by his laſt Teſtament very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Donations for their relief and ſupport: After this Family of <hi>Greenſhield</hi> was moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered away at <hi>Hamwold,</hi> I find the <hi>Elis's</hi> inveſted in the Poſſeſſion, but whether by Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or Purchaſe I cannot diſcover. After they went out, the Family of <hi>Francis</hi> was by Purchaſe from them, ſeated in the Inheritance, to whoſe Intereſt it was not many years united, for from them it paſſed away by Sale to <hi>Wilſon,</hi> where the Title was not leſs violate, and curſory; for from <hi>Wilſon</hi> the like Alienation tranſlated the right of it into <hi>Parboe,</hi> whoſe Widow Mrs. <hi>Parboe</hi> does now enjoy it, as being made part of her Jointure when firſt ſhe matched with <hi>Parboe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Grove</hi> and upper <hi>Hamwold</hi> are two little Mannors circumſcribed likewiſe within the Limits of <hi>Wodnesborough;</hi> and were in the thirty ſecond year of <hi>Ed.</hi> the third the Inheritance of <hi>Pet. de Goldesburgh,</hi> or <hi>Goldesborough,</hi> but the Title made no long abode in this Name after this Man's <hi>Exit;</hi> for both, about the latter End of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:103337:192"/>were conveyed to <hi>Langley</hi> of <hi>Knowlton,</hi> from whom as ſuddain a Devolution, about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the fixth, paſſed them over to Sir <hi>John White</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> a Merchant of the <hi>Staple,</hi> and he died poſſeſt of them in the ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, as appears, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 25. After this Family was worn out, I find <hi>Stokes</hi> planted in the Poſſeſſion; from which Name about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, they came over by Purchaſe to one <hi>Nicholas Mois</hi> Gentleman, and when that Family deſerted the Poſſeſſion which was in our Grand-fathers Remembrance a Fatality pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the former, made them both parcel of the Patrimony of <hi>Everard,</hi> by whom not many years ſince, they were alienated to <hi>James</hi> to the Inheritance of which Family they remain yet linked and united.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Poltmans</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Poultmans</hi> yielded both Seat and Sirname to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of ſome Eſtimate in this Track, who had here a Caſtellated Manſion, inveſted with a Moat, and continued Lords of this Habitation, until <hi>Peter Poltman</hi> by deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant right came to be poſſeſt of it, and he about the fifteenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond conveyed it by Fine to <hi>Langley</hi> of <hi>Knowlton,</hi> in whom the Propriety was ſetled but until the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then it was paſſed away by Sale to Sir <hi>John White:</hi> who, dying ſeiſed of it in the ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, by Teſtament ordered it to be ſold for the improvement of Acts of Charity, and pious Uſes, and was according to the Tenor of his will conveyed by Sale to <hi>Boteler</hi> of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronden</hi> in <hi>Eaſtry,</hi> and there it made its abode until our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was paſſed away to <hi>Benskin,</hi> in which Family the Title is yet permanent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Woditon</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Kinghamford</hi> hath three places in it of conſiderable Eſtimate. The firſt is <hi>Gedding</hi> which K. <hi>Cedwall</hi> and <hi>Keneldrith</hi> his Queen, in the year of <hi>Grace</hi> 693 gave to <hi>Theodore</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Covent of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> free (as the original Donation informs me) as <hi>Adeſham,</hi> and was by them afterwards aſſigned to the Sacriſt or Sexton of <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> for his lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Subſiſtance, an Office in elder Times of no contemptible Account in the Repute and Vogue of the Monks of that Cloiſter; for the ſacred Utenſils of the Church were not only committed to his Care and Cuſtody, but he was likewiſe to make Preparation for the Celebration of the Maſs, and the performance of other divine and ſacred Officers, and becauſe he might be more active and vigorous in the Managery and execution of his Truſt, theſe under-Officers were to be ſubſervient and and miniſterial to him, their Catalogue ſollows.</p>

               <p>For which laſt (the reſt being of eaſie underſtanding,) I conceive it was one that either wrought the Church Veſtments, or Hangings, and the like, in Gold, or that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed them, when they were dim or tarniſhed. But to proceed: this Mannor being with the Remainder of the Revenue of the Priory of <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> ſurrendred into the Hands of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his reign, who afterwards in the thirty firſt of his Government granted it to Mr. <hi>Edward Foch</hi> of <hi>Hells Court</hi> in this Pariſh; from whom it deſcended to <hi>Thomas Foch</hi> of <hi>Monkton</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Thanet</hi> Eſquire, who deceaſing not many years ſince gave it to his ſecond Son Major <hi>John Foch</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and he hath lately paſſed it away to his elder Brother <hi>Thomas Foch</hi> Eſquire.</p>

                  <hi>Wickham Buſhes</hi> is another Mannor which has its Situation within the Limits of <hi>Woditon,</hi> and was, as the Light of the moſt ancient Evidences does guide us to believe, the Patrimony of <hi>Guldeford;</hi> for <hi>Henry de Guldeford,</hi> (as the Book of <hi>Aid</hi> diſcovers to us) did hold it by Knights Service, of <hi>Geffrey de Say,</hi> in the twentieth year of <hi>Ed.</hi> the third; but in a Deſcent or two after, this Family was ſhrunk away from the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this place, and then the ancient and illuſtrious Family of <hi>Digge</hi> of <hi>Digge's Court</hi> in <hi>Berham,</hi> was the next which ſucceeded in the Propriety and Inheritance, and to this Name was the Title of this place, by a ſucceſſive Series of many Generations faſtned, till in our Fathers Memory it was by ſale rent off, and by that Alienation linked to the Revenue of <hi>Coppen,</hi> in whoſe Demeaſn the Intereſt of it at this Day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues included.</p>

                  <hi>Woodchurch</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Blackbourn,</hi> was the Habitation of a Family of as deep Root in Antiquity as any in this Track, who extracted their Sirname, as well as borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their firſt Original, from this place. <hi>Roger de Woodchurch</hi> is the firſt who does occurre, who in the ancient Evidences and the Deeds of this place, which are not cloiſtered within any Date finds a frequent Mention, and from him (as appears by an old Pedigree of this Family) did it devolve to his Grandchild Sir <hi>Simon de Woodchurch,</hi> who is in the Regiſter of thoſe eminent Perſons who accompanied <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt in his Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and triumphant Expedition into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where his Victories entailed upon his Memory the Character of <hi>Malleus Scotorum,</hi> but in this Sir <hi>Simon:</hi> the Name though not the Male Line determined, for he by matching with <hi>Suſan,</hi> Heir of <hi>Henry le Clerke</hi> of <hi>Munfidde,</hi> brought a large Inheritance to own the Signory of <hi>Woodchurch;</hi> and his Succeſſors in Gratitude to a Family which had added ſo much of ſplendor, and annexed ſo plentiful a Revenue to this Name, altered their paternal Appellation from <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church</hi> to <hi>Clerke;</hi> and ſo in all their Deeds ſubſequent to this Match, have written <hi>Clerke</hi> aliàs <hi>Woodchurch</hi> ever ſince. But as all Families have their Deſcent and Period, as well as Gradation and Aſcent, ſo had this; for after this Mannor had for ſo many hundred years continued in this Family which had been productive of Men which had been planted in places of the greateſt Eminence, by which they were obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Service to their Country, it came down at laſt to <hi>Humfrey Clerk</hi> Eſquire, who about the year 1594, paſſed it away by Sale to <hi>Walter Harlackenden</hi> Eſquire; by whoſe Daughter and Heir called <hi>Deborah Harlackenden,</hi> it was united to the Revenue of Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> Knight and Baronet: upon whoſe late Deceaſe it is now deſcended to his Grand-child Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> Baronet, who is entitled to the inſtant Signory of it.</p>

                  <hi>Henherſt</hi> is the laſt place conſiderable in <hi>Woodchurch,</hi> which was the poſſeſſion of a Family of that Denomination, of whom I have ſpoken at <hi>Stapleherſt,</hi> where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed another Mannor of this Name, and of which Family this here was but a Cadet or younger Slip, and was written ſometimes <hi>Henherſt,</hi> and as often in old Deeds <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſt,</hi> and continued Owners of this place, until the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and then it devolved to Sir <hi>Thomas Hengherſt,</hi> who was the laſt of that Name which held this place, for he dying without Iſſue Male, <hi>Humfrey Wiſe</hi> who had matched with his Daughter and Heir in her right was inveſted in the Inheritance of it, but he deceaſing likewiſe without Iſſue Male, his ſole Inheritrix united it by marriage to the Revenue of her Husband Mr. <hi>Robert Maſters,</hi> Great Grand-father to Mr. <hi>Edward Maſters</hi> of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> in whom the propriety of this place is at this prefent continued.</p>

                  <hi>Henden</hi> likewiſe is an Appendage to <hi>Woodchurch,</hi> from whence certainly the Name of <hi>Henden</hi> originally ſtreamed out, though it be brought down to our Times in ſo crooked and perplexed a Chanel, that we cannot diſcover it in all the wandrings and Digreſſions of it, though the Family was made more conſpicuous, by Sir <hi>Edward Henden</hi> one of the Barons of the Exchequer to the late King <hi>Charles:</hi> who for his clear ſpeculation and inſight into the deepeſt and moſt myſterious Intrigues of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Law of <hi>England,</hi> was commonly called the Picklock of it. But this is a Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: The ancient Proprietaries of <hi>Henden,</hi> repreſented to us by the eldeſt Records, were the Lords <hi>Burwaſh,</hi> very frequently written <hi>Burghherſt,</hi> and <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Lord <hi>Burwaſh</hi> had a Charter of Free Warren granted to <hi>Henden,</hi> in the eighteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. And when this Family had deſerted the Poſſeſſion of this place, the next which ſucceſſively held it were the <hi>Capells</hi> of <hi>Capells Court</hi> in <hi>Ivie-Church,</hi> and <hi>Richard Capell</hi> died ſeiſed of it in the fifteenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond: and here, after it had been for ſome Generations fixed, the Name reſolved into a Daughter and Heir, who was matched unto <hi>Harlackenden,</hi> and ſo it became twiſted into the Revenue of that Family, and ſo remained till <hi>Deborah Harlackenden</hi> the Heir General of <hi>Walter Harlackenden,</hi> a Branch of this Stock, by being wedded to Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> Knight and Baronet, Grand-father to Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> now of <hi>Tunſtall</hi> Baronet, wound it up in the Demeaſn and Intereſt of that Honourable Family.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Borough</hi> of <hi>Harlackenden</hi> is ſituated in this Pariſh, and has been for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of years the Patrimonial Demeaſn of that Name and Family, as appears by a Tomb in the Church of <hi>Woodchurch,</hi> whoſe Inſcription ſignifies that one of them lies enterr'd there a little after the Conqueſt: and though the Character be in the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Shape of it very much like that which was in uſe in the reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and ſo makes the Truth of it diſputable, yet to this 'tis anſwered, that there was an old Tombſtone there before, with the ſame Inſcription upon it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculped peradventure in a <hi>Saxon</hi> Character, or ſuch an one as was proportionate to that time in which that perſon died, who lies there entombed: which being decayed his Succeſſors to perpetuate and inforce the Memory of ſo ancient a Predeceſſor, fixed this Stone upon his Grave, and, to make the Memorial more obvious, did cauſe the Epitaph to be engraven in ſuch a Letter, as was Cuſtomary to the Time of that Prince, in whoſe reign it was laid upon the Aſhes beneath. In <hi>Greys Inne</hi> Hall by particular Inſpection I have obſerved the Arms of this Family, <hi>viz.

The firſt place of eminence which offers it ſelf to a Survey, is <hi>Witreſham,</hi> which anciently belonged to the Monks of <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church,</hi> and was given to that Cloiſter, in the year 132, by <hi>Edſin</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Martins</hi> without <hi>Cant.</hi> but upon the Suppreſſion of that Covent in the reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> the eighth, this Mannor with all its appendant was Immunities granted to <hi>Hen. Criſpe</hi> Esq; whoſe Son <hi>Nicholas Criſpe,</hi> held it the ſixth of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and after him <hi>James Hales</hi> Eſquire: and he in the thirteenth of that Princeſs alienated it to <hi>Freak,</hi> in which Family it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:103337:197"/>untill the Beginning of King <hi>James;</hi> and then it was conveyed by Sir <hi>Thomas Freak,</hi> to Sir <hi>Thomas Biſhop,</hi> and he in the ſixteenth year of the aboveſaid Prince, gave it in marriage with his Daughter Mrs. <hi>Jane Biſhop,</hi> to <hi>Edward Alford</hi> Eſquire; and ſhe in right of that original Settlement does now hold this Mannor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palſtre</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Witreſham,</hi> which repreſents to us the memory of <hi>John de Palſtre,</hi> who was anciently Lord of the Fee: but before the end of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, this Family was vaniſhed; and then the <hi>Charles's,</hi> a Family of generous rank at <hi>Addington</hi> were ſetled in the poſſeſſion, and <hi>Richard Charles</hi> held it, in the fifth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and ſo did <hi>Nicholas Charles,</hi> who dyed poſſeſt of it in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year of that Prince, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 16. And from this Family by <hi>Alice</hi> one of the Coheirs, it devolved to <hi>William Snath,</hi> and he concluding in a Daughter and Heir, ſhe by matching with <hi>Watton,</hi> brought it to be united to the patrimony of this Family. And here it made its Re dence untill the reign of <hi>Heury</hi> the ſixth; and then it was paſſed away to <hi>Robert Rudſton</hi> Eſquire, who being embarked in the reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in the Deſign of Sir <hi>Thomas Wiatt,</hi> although he did not forfeit his Life, yet he did that of his Eſtate, which by the ſpecial Indulgence of that Princeſſe, was granted back to him, in the ſecond year of her reign, in which this was involved, which remained with this Family untill allmoſt our Time; and then it was paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Sir <hi>Edward Henden,</hi> one of the Barons of the Exchequer, who dying not long ſince without Iſſue, gave it to his Nephew Sir <hi>John Henden,</hi> Father to <hi>Edw. Henden</hi> Esq; the inſtant Lord of the Fee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Owlye</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Witreſham,</hi> which anciently was written <hi>Ovely,</hi> as having owners of that Sirname, who ſtayed not here untill the Beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, but were extinguiſhed, and left the poſſeſſion to <hi>Ao Odiarne,</hi> a Family ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of good Note. After whom I cannot (becauſe the private Evidences are embezel'd) diſcover what Families were ſucceſſively planted in the poſſeſſion. Only I find it about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Mayney</hi> of <hi>Biddenden,</hi> in whom the Intereſt continued, untill ſome few years ſince it was alienated by Sir <hi>John Mayney</hi> of <hi>Linton</hi> Knight and Baronet, to <hi>Peter Ricaut</hi> Eſquire, who hath lately alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated his right in it to Mr. <hi>Menell</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ebeney</hi> was given to the Monks of <hi>Chriſtchurch</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by K. <hi>Athulfus,</hi> at the particular entreaty and inſtigation of <hi>Ceolnoth</hi> the Arch-biſhop, in the year 832, to the Reparation of their Cloiſter and Cathedral. The words regiſtred in the Latine Record are theſe, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 832, <hi>Rex Athulfus inſtinctu Ceolnothi Archiepiſcopi dedit Ebeneyam ad opus Monachorum, Libere ſicut Adiſham.</hi> But when the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties of the Monks, who had cloiſtered up Religion it ſelf in a Lazy Cell, grew ſo clamorous, that they called for Vengeance upon their Seminaties, that Storm aroſe in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, which by the Diſſolution of their Covents, expiated their Irregularities; this Mannor was ſurrendered to the Crown, and the aboveſaid Prince, in the thirty ſecond year of his Government, granted it to Sir <hi>Walter Henley</hi> Serjeant at Law, who dying without Iſſue-male, his three Daughters, namely <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> married to <hi>William Waller</hi> Eſquire, <hi>Hellen</hi> firſt wedded to <hi>Thomas Colepeper</hi> of <hi>Bedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> Eſquire; ſecondly to Sir <hi>George Somerſet;</hi> and thirdly to <hi>Thomas Vane</hi> of <hi>Burſton</hi> Eſquire; and <hi>Anne</hi> matched to <hi>Richard Covert</hi> of <hi>Slaugham,</hi> as his Coheirs entered upon his Inheritance, and then this place upon the Diviſion of his eſtate, increaſed the Demeaſn of <hi>Richard Covert</hi> Eſquire, from whom by the Devolution of a deſcendant right, the title is now lodged in his Succeſſor Mr...... <hi>Covert.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVoodrove</hi> in <hi>Ebeney,</hi> acknowledged in elder Ages a Family for proprietaries, known by the Name of <hi>Mocking,</hi> who had a revenue likewiſe about <hi>Milton, Stockbury, Hartlip</hi> and <hi>Shepey,</hi> of no deſpicable Bulk. <hi>John Mocking</hi> Son of <hi>VVilliam Mocking</hi> flouriſhed under the Scepter of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and held this Mannor at his Deceaſe, which was in the eleventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 75. And in this Family did the poſſeſſion fix, untill the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and then it began to ebbe away from this Name, and flow by the conveyance of Sale into <hi>Guldford:</hi> and in a very old Schedule which enumerates the Mannors, which related to <hi>John Guldford,</hi> who lived under the Government of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth and <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, this is regiſtred in the Catalogue; and from him did it come down to Sir <hi>Edward Guldford,</hi> whoſe Daughter and Heir <hi>Joan,</hi> brought it to be the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:103337:197"/>patrimony of <hi>John Dudley</hi> Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and he gave this Mannor with no ſmall demeaſn at <hi>Halden,</hi> in Dower with <hi>Mary</hi> his Daughter, matched to Sir <hi>Hen. Sidney</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Knight of the Garter, a perſon of that Value and Eminence, that he that would diſcover him repreſented in his beſt Features and proportion muſt view him in his Worthy and Signal undertakings in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he will find him better pourtraid, than he can be by any faint or drowſie Attributes, that drop from my humble and unequal pen; and from him did this Mannor in right of this Alliance, deſcend to his Grandchild the right honorable <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> who not many years ſince paſſed it away to Sir <hi>Edward Hendon,</hi> one of the Barons of the Exchequer, who upon his Deceaſe gave it to his Nephew Sir <hi>John Hondon</hi> of <hi>Biddenden,</hi> and he not long ſince alienated it to Mr. <hi>John Auſtin</hi> of <hi>Tenter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> from whom it is lately devolved by Death, to be now the poſſeſſion of his ſecond Brother Mr. <hi>Rob. Auſtin</hi> of <hi>Hall-place</hi> in <hi>Bexley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brocket</hi> is another Mannor in <hi>Ebeney</hi> which had poſſeſſors as appears by ancient Deeds of that Name, who likewiſe were written in Evidences <hi>Brocket;</hi> but whether the <hi>Brockets</hi> of <hi>Brocket-hall</hi> in the County of <hi>Hartford,</hi> were deſcended from theſe, or theſe from them, I cannot diſcover: But the greateſt honor which this obſcure Mannor hath acquired, is, that ever ſince the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, untill the thirtieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, it acknowledged the noble Family of <hi>Guldford;</hi> and then it changed its proprietaries: for that year it was by <hi>John Guldford</hi> Eſquire, conveyed to Sir <hi>John Hales</hi> Baton of the Exchequer, from whom it is now come down to own the proprietary of his Deſcendant, Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> of <hi>Tunſtall</hi> Baronet.</p>
               <p>The Iſland of <hi>Shepey,</hi> comes next to be treated of: It called by <hi>Ptolomie Toliatis,</hi> in Latin <hi>Inſula Ovium,</hi> in Saxon <hi>Sceapige,</hi> all agreeing in their Verdict, that it was ſo named from its plenty of Sheep. It is environed with the mixed Waters of the <hi>Thames,</hi> and <hi>Medway</hi> on the Weſt, the <hi>Swale</hi> or <hi>Genlade</hi> on the South, and the Main Ocean beats on the Eaſt and North; more celebrated for the fertility of the Soil, then Salurbity of Air which is groſſe and thick, cauſing Aguiſh Infirmities, that keep long Reſidence, they get poſſeſſion,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quinborough,</hi> or rather originally <hi>Kingsborough,</hi> as <hi>Konisbergh</hi> in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> is now cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly called <hi>Quensborough,</hi> acknowledged King <hi>Edward</hi> the third for the Founder, who (having wedded <hi>Philippa</hi> Daughter of <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Henault</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions often calling him to paſſe into her Fathers Dominion, whoſe Aid and Aſſiſtance he required in the great enterpriſe, for the Recovery of his undoubted right to the Diadem of <hi>France</hi>) heerected this ſtrong and ſtately Fottreſſe for defence of the mouth of the <hi>Thames,</hi> and his own ſecure Accomodation. And becauſe the Situation of this place was unhealthy, he (to allure Inhabitants) in the year 1366, enobled the Town with a Charter of Incorporation, wherein he indulges by Grant ample priviledges and Immunities unto it, as namely to hold two Mercates weekly, one on the Munday and the other on the Thurſday; and two Fairs yearly, one at the Feaſt of St. <hi>James,</hi> the other on the twenty fourth of <hi>March,</hi> and to make Choice of Burgeſſes to ſend to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The principal Architect and Surveyout of the work, was <hi>William Wickham,</hi> after Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who had been formerly employed in that kind, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying <hi>Windſor-caſtle,</hi> when his good patron <hi>John de Vuedal,</hi> was Conſtable there. This man uſed to inſcribe on the edifices thus erected, this Inſcription, This made <hi>VVickham,</hi> whereby ſome conceived, he arrogated to himſelf the Coſt and payment of the Structure, and informed the King thereof: but his ingenious expoſition ſatisfied that Prince, when he ſhewed him that by his Inſpection and Inſight into thoſe matters, he had obtained both his Eccleſiaſtical and ſecular promotions, being made Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> firſt Keeper of the privy Seal, and then of the King's Conſcience, his laſt Gradation or Aſcent being to be Lord Chancellor of <hi>England.</hi> When King <hi>Edward</hi> had perfected this Caſtle, he inſtituted a Chief Governour, who was for the future, to carry the Title of Conſtable, like as at <hi>Dover-caſtle,</hi> and elſewhere. The Catalogue of thoſe who ſucceeded in that Command, I have ſet down. The care and coſt of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in the year 1536 to repair this place, when he erected Fortreſſes for Defence of the Sea Coaſt, drew this Eulogie from the Pen of <hi>Leland,</hi>

                  <hi>Minſter</hi> is the next place of Account in this Iſland, and is contracted from the Latin Word <hi>Monaſterium,</hi> from whence this Town hath its Appellation, and may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the third place amongſt our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nunneries. For <hi>Sexburga</hi> Daughter to <hi>Ercombert</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> (to whom and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Church of this Pariſh is devoted and dedicated) in the year 664, erected a Religious Houſe at this place, and liberally endowed it, for the Suſtentation of vayled Virgins. The ſecond was founded by <hi>Eanſwith</hi> Daughter of <hi>Eadbald</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> at <hi>Folkston.</hi> And the firſt had its Inſtitution at <hi>Liminge,</hi> likewiſe in this County, by <hi>Eadburga,</hi> and erected to the Honor of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and St. <hi>Mildred.</hi> But the Antiquity of this Cell, and the Sanctity attributed to it by elder times, could not ſo skreen or reſcue it from the Heat of War, but it was thrice ſacked and diſmantled by the barbarous irruptions of the <hi>Danes,</hi> within leſſe then an Age, which by uſual Account is ſaid to be thirty year. The firſt mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune happened to it in the year 832, when thirty five Sail of them rived here and rifled it. The ſecond and third time, was in the year 851 and then again in the year 855, by the Armies of them who wintered their Ships within this Iſland. Beſides theſe depredations the complices of Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> and his Sons, in the Time of their proſcription and exile, which was in the year 1052, landed in this Iſland, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably harraſſed it, by filling all places with Ruine and Devaſtation. Indeed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion when it glitters with a ſplendid and full revenue, is like the Pictures of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Saints, apparelled in rich Garments, which ſome have been enticed to rob, not out of ill Will to their Sanctity, but love to their Shrines, and Beauty of their Cloaths; Perſecution and the Robes of Humility were the Attire of the primitive Church, and when ſhe is dreſſed up in gaudy Fortunes, it is no more then ſhe merits: Yet ſometimes it occaſions the Devil, to cheat her of her Holineſſe; and impious men by an unjuſt and injurious Sacriledge, to cheat her of her riches. But I have digreſſed: I now return into the Track of my Diſcourſe, and muſt inform my Reader, that although the Glory of this Cloiſter, was ſo bowed down and broken with theſe misfortunes, that it appeared almoſt ſunk in its own Calamities: yet by the piety of ſubſequent Ages, it was buoyed up again: but more eſpecially by the indulgent Charity of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, who in the firſt year of his reign confirmed their old priviledges, and to thoſe added by patent many new. And in this Condition it
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:103337:198"/>continued untill the general Diſſolution or Deluge, and then it was by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his reign granted to Sir <hi>Thomas Cheyney:</hi> and his Son <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cheyney,</hi> having in the Beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> exchanged it for other Lands with that Princeſſe; ſhe regranted it to Sir <hi>Edward Hobby,</hi> who had matched with her Kinſwoman <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> and his Son Sir <hi>Edward Hobby,</hi> about the middle of King <hi>James</hi> paſſed it away to Mr. <hi>Hen. Richards,</hi> and he upon his Deceaſe bequeathed it to <hi>Gabriel Liveſey</hi> Eſquire; and he, almoſt in our Remembrance, conveyed it to Sir <hi>John Heyward,</hi> who ſetled it upon his two Feoffees in Truſt, Sir <hi>Francis Buller</hi> of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Clerk</hi> of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> for ſuch Charitable Uſes, as they ſhould think proportionate to that Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</p>
               <p>The Mannor of <hi>Northwood,</hi> is ſituated in this Pariſh, which was the Inheritance of <hi>Jordanus de Scapeia,</hi> for ſo he is written in old dateleſſe Deeds, and he had Iſſue <hi>Stephen de Northwood,</hi> who was the firſt whom I find in Record, to have aſſumed this Appellation, and he was Father to Sir <hi>Roger de Northwood,</hi> who lies buryed in <hi>Minſter</hi> Church, with an Inſcription affixed to his Monument, which ſeems by its more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Character, to have been corrupted; It is this: <hi>Hic jacet Rogerus Northwood, Miles, ſepultus ante Conqueſtum.</hi> Indeed his Figure is fairly inſculped in Braſſe, with that of his Lady <hi>Bona</hi> lying by him, who was Siſter and Heir of <hi>William de Wauton.</hi> The vulgar upon a credulous errour every where affirm, that all thoſe who are thus buryed, were enterr'd after the Conqueſt; when it is certain that many were entom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in this poſture, many years before the Conquerour, that had obliged themſelves by Vow, to defend the Croſſe and Sepulcher of our Saviour, againſt the Fury and Aſſaults of Infidels. Sure I am, the Tomb next to this appears to be far more ancient, and of ſo venerable a Form, that its like doth not occurre in any other place; there is not any Letter of Inſcription left, only the Coat is a ſure Teſtimony, that it was one of the Anceſtors of the Family of <hi>Northwood.</hi> But to proceed: <hi>John Norwood</hi> one of this Houſe, as the private Records of the Family teſtifie, feaſted <hi>H.</hi> the fifth, at the <hi>Red Lion</hi> in <hi>Sedingbourne,</hi> and the Wine amounted upon the wole account but to 9. s. and 9. d. Wine being then rated but at a penny the pint. <hi>W. Northwood</hi> another of this Name, and Family, did ſignal Service at the Battel of <hi>Agincourt,</hi> and afterwards at the Battel of <hi>Vernoile,</hi> which was managed by <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Regent of <hi>France.</hi> He was Kinſman of <hi>John Northwood,</hi> who was the laſt of this Name at this place; for he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the latter end of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, alienated it to <hi>VVilliam VVarner</hi> Eſquire; whoſe Son and Heir <hi>VVilliam VVarner,</hi> about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it to Sir <hi>Thomas Cheyney,</hi> and his Son Sir <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cheyney,</hi> having exchanged it for other Lands with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it remained with the Crown, untill King <hi>James</hi> in the ſecond year of his reign, granted it to the right honorable <hi>Philip Herbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and afterwards Earl of <hi>Pembroke.</hi>

                  <hi>Newhall</hi> is another little Mannor in <hi>Minſter,</hi> which <hi>Fulke Peyforer</hi> dyed ſeiſed of, in the ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond; and from him it devolved by deſcent to be the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of his great Grandchild <hi>Fulk Peyforer,</hi> and his Sole Heir <hi>Julian</hi> carried it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to <hi>Thomas St. Leger</hi> of <hi>Ottringden,</hi> whoſe two Female Coheirs being matched to <hi>Aucher</hi> and <hi>Ewias,</hi> ſhared his Inheritance, and about the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, paſſed it away by Sale to <hi>Cromer,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor <hi>VVilliam Cromer,</hi> having about the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, by ſome miſdemeanor, forfeited it to the Crown, it was granted to one <hi>Stephen Graine,</hi> in which Family it remained untill the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then it was alienated to <hi>Small;</hi> from which Name, the ſame Viciſſitude not many years ſince carried it off to <hi>Luck;</hi> who tranſmitted his Right in it to Mr. <hi>Henry Newton,</hi> who hath lately demiſed it to Mr. <hi>Joſias Gering</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Riſhingdon</hi> is the laſt place of Account, which is circumſcribed within the Limits of <hi>Minſter.</hi> It was in the twenty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, wrapped up in the patrimony of <hi>Savage:</hi> for at that time <hi>John de Savage</hi> obtained a Charter of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrren, to ſeveral of his Mannors in <hi>Kont,</hi> in the Number of which this is regiſtered for one; but in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, the poſſeſſion was departed from this Family, being purchaſed by <hi>Philippa</hi> Wife and Queen to <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and ſetled upon the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Katharines</hi> neere the <hi>Tower,</hi> in whoſe demeaſn it hath layn
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:103337:199"/>involved ever ſince. In the fourteenth year of the reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the King's Uncle, was Leſſee to that Hoſpital, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 113. Which I mention to diſcover to the Reader, that even in thoſe Times, Perſons of the greateſt eminence did not diſdain to be Tenants for an Eſtate to an Hoſpital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eaſt-Church</hi> is the next place which comes to be conſidered: Which though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure in it ſelf, yet is made eminent by <hi>Shurland,</hi> which is a Limb of this Pariſh, and anciently did own a noble Family which bore that Sirname; the laſt of which was Sir <hi>Robert de Shurland,</hi> who was one of thoſe <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Bannerets, which were made by King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, at the Siege of <hi>Carlaverock,</hi> in the twenty eighth year of his reign, and to whom the former Prince, as a farther Symbol or Teſtimony of his Merit, granted a Charter of Free-warren in the twenty ninth year of his reign, to his Mannor of <hi>Shurland:</hi> not long after which he deceaſed, and lies entombed under an Arch in the Southwall, with his pourtraicture inſculped in a Marble, in <hi>Minſter</hi> Church, whoſe Tomb is become the Scene of much Falſhood and popular errour; the vulgar having digged out of his Vault, many wild Legends and Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as namely that he buryed a Prieſt alive, that he ſwam on his horſe two miles thorough the Sea, to the King, who was then neer this Iſland on Shipboard, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe his pardon; and having obtained it, ſwam back to the Shore: where being arrived, he cut off the head of his ſaid Horſe, becauſe it was affirmed, he had acted this by Magick: and that riding on hunting a twelvemoneth after, his horſe ſtumbled and threw him on the Scull of his former Horſe, which blow ſo bruiſed him, that from that Contuſion he contracted an inward impoſtumation, of which he dyed; and in memory of which, an Horſe Head is placed at his Feet; which fictitious Story, is rent into the diſunion of ſo many abſurd circumſtances, that I ſhall repreſent to the Reader, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which this fabulous Natrative was formerly eſtabliſhed, which is no more but this. Sir <hi>Robert de Shurland</hi> above-mentioned, being Lord Warden of the Cinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and a man of eminent Authority under <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, obtained Grant of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge by Charter, to have wrack of Sea upon his Lands confining on the Sea Shore, neere <hi>Shurland:</hi> now the extent of this Royaltie is evermore eſteemed to reach as far into the Water, upon a low ebb, as a man can ride in, and touch any thing with the point of his Launce, and ſo you have the explication of this marvel; and the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching either of whole Creatures, or part of them, at the Feet of worthy perſonages, is moſt frequent both now and in elder Times, that theſe inanimate Repreſentations might be the Symbols or Hieroglyphicks, to intimate to poſterity thoſe Virtues which were reſident in them when alive. But to proceed: the abovementioned Sir <hi>Robert de Shurland,</hi> having improved his Reputation with many noble and worthy Actions, left That only to perpetuate his Name to poſterity, having no Iſſue-male to continue it: for he left only one Daughter and Heir, matched to <hi>W. de Cheyney</hi> of <hi>Patricksbourn Cheyney,</hi> who was ſon and heir to Sir <hi>Alexander de Cheyney,</hi> who is in the Inventory or Liſt of thoſe Knights Bannerets, who were ennobled with that Dignity, by <hi>E.</hi> the firſt, at the Siege of <hi>Carlaverock,</hi> in the twenty eighth year of his reign, and in Right of this Match, dyed poſſeſt of it, in the eighth year of <hi>E.</hi> the third, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 58. And from him did it come down to his great Grandchild, Sir <hi>John Cheyney</hi> who was Knight of the Garter, and frequently Knight of this Shire, in ſundry Parliaments, under the Government of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, in the firſt year of whoſe reign, as our Chronicles inform us, he was ſent Embaſſador to ſeveral forreign Princes, to repreſent to them the Reaſons or Motives which induced him to aſſume the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diadem, and in the firſt and ſecond year of that Prince, he was choſen Speaker of Parliament. Sir <hi>William Cheyney</hi> another of this Family of <hi>Shurland,</hi> was firſt a Judge, and ſecondly Lord Chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth: but the greateſt Honour this Mannor atchieved, was when it came to be poſſeſt by Sir <hi>Thomas Cheyney</hi> who was Knight of the Garter, Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, Conſtable of <hi>Quinborough</hi> Caſtle, and one of the Privy Councel to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and he had Iſſue Sir <hi>Henry Cheyney,</hi> created <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cheyney</hi> of <hi>Tuddington</hi> by Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> who having exchanged this Mannor of <hi>Shurland</hi> with that Princeſſe, it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the patrimony of the Crown, untill the ſecond year of King <hi>James;</hi> and then it was by royal Conceſſion from that Prince, made the Inheritance of <hi>Philip</hi> Earl
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:103337:199"/>of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and after of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> upon whoſe late deceaſe it is now come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Signory of his ſecond Son Mr. <hi>James Herbert.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kingsborough</hi> is another Mannor in this Pariſh, whoſe Name tacitly intimates to us, that it was involved formerly in the Revenue of the Crown, and was the place which the Inhabitants frequented, not only for the holding of a Court, for the choice and election of the Conſtables of the Iſland: but likewiſe here aſſembled to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and appoint thoſe Wardens or Bailiffs, that were to take Cogniſance or Charge of the paſſage called <hi>King ferry;</hi> which divides the Iſland, and the main Land of me County; this Mannor after it had for many Generations layn folded up in the royal Demeaſne, was by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> granted to Mr. <hi>Henry Cary;</hi> who about the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of K. <hi>James,</hi> paſſed it away to <hi>Swaleman,</hi> whoſe Deſcendant is ſtill entituled to the propriety of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leiſdon</hi> next offers it ſelfe up to our view, which was parcel of that eſtate which acknowledged the noble and ancient Family of <hi>Grey</hi> or <hi>Rotherfield</hi> in <hi>Suſſex</hi> for its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Owners, The firſt which made this Family eminent was <hi>John de Grey,</hi> who was frequently ſummoned to ſit in Parliament as Baron, in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and dyed poſſeſt of this Mannor in the thirty third year of that Prince, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 38. And ſo did <hi>Robert Grey</hi> his Succeſſor, in the ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. After his <hi>Exit,</hi> I do not find it long conſtant to the Signory of this Name: for about the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth it was alienated to <hi>Lovell;</hi> and by virtue of this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, Sir <hi>William Lovell</hi> held it at his Death, which was in the twenty third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth. After this Family had abandoned the poſſeſſion, the <hi>Cheyneys</hi> of <hi>Shurland</hi> were by purchaſe planted in the Inheritance, and remained ſetled in the Fee-ſimple of it, untill Sir <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cheyney,</hi> exchanged it with Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nuts</hi> called ſo vulgarly, but in the ancient Court-rolls named <hi>Notts,</hi> as being the Inheritance of a Family called <hi>Nott,</hi> is a little Mannor in <hi>Leiſdon,</hi> which after it had for many deſcents acknowledged no other proprietaries, but this Family, about the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, was rent from them by purchaſe, and tranſplanted into <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> a Family which were Owners anciently of much Land about <hi>Ling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, Throuley,</hi> and other places in that Track, and continued Maſters of this Lordſhip, untill the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; and then it was conveyed to Sir <hi>Thomas Cheyney;</hi> whoſe Son Sir <hi>Henry Cheyney</hi> about the Beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> paſſed it away to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> a Family which had been poſſeſſors of <hi>Sampſon-court,</hi> not far diſtant many hundred years; and were deſcended from <hi>William Sampſon,</hi> who was frequently ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to ſit in Parliament as Baron in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt. From <hi>Sampſon</hi> it was again in our Fathers Memory carried off to <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Werdon</hi> is the laſt place of Account in this Iſland; It was in times of an elder In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription involved in the Inheritance of <hi>Savage</hi> of <hi>Bobbing,</hi> and in the twenty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, Sir <hi>John de Savage</hi> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <hi>Werdon:</hi> But before the middle of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, this Family had ſurrendered their Intereſt here to <hi>Fremingham;</hi> for <hi>John de Fremingham</hi> dyed ſeiſed of it, in the twenty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third: but whether it devolved with other Land by the Heir general of <hi>Fremingham</hi> to <hi>Iſley</hi> or not, is incertain, becauſe thoſe privtae evidences which relate to this Mannor, extend no higher then the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth; and then I find the propriety of it in <hi>Norton,</hi> in which Family after the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion had reſided untill our times, it was conveyed to <hi>Edmund Tooke</hi> of <hi>Dartford</hi> Esq; Barriſter at Law, now proprietary of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thanet</hi> lies, if not all, yet moſt part of it, circumſcribed within the Hundred of <hi>Ringleſlow:</hi> It is ſtyled in Greek by ancient Authors <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in Latine <hi>Thanetum,</hi> and in the Saxon it is curtailed into <hi>Thanet,</hi> which an old Manuſcript which I have ſeen, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces from two Saxon Words <hi>Thane</hi> and <hi>Yete,</hi> which in that Language then implyed as much as the Lords-Entrance: but for my particular, I believe that the Saxons, when upon the Donation of it to them by <hi>Vortiger,</hi> they firſt entered into this Iſland, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that <hi>Thanetum</hi> was a Latine Name impoſed upon it by the Romans, who had but newly then deſerted the Protection of this Iſland, new-ſoftned the Name by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:103337:200"/>it, and then quilted it into the Alphabet of their own Language, and called it <hi>Thanett;</hi> and that this is probable, I ſhall evince from circumſtances, <hi>Punio</hi> in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſignifies to puniſh, from whence the <hi>Saxons</hi> ſtyled that place by <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> where they puniſhed Malefactors <hi>Pinandun Hoath:</hi> So <hi>Caſtrum</hi> was a Name uſed by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans to ſignifie or expreſſe any Caſtle or Fortreſſe, which the <hi>Saxons</hi> upon their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into this Iſland, finding it to be impoſed upon all places of ſtrength and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, adopted it into their Dialect, and from the word <hi>Caſtrum</hi> extracted the word <hi>Ceaſter.</hi> I could inſtance in many other particulars, but that I ſhould both weary my Reader, and clog this Diſcourſe with Superfluities: I ſhall therefore from the untwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the Name, deſcend to the Deſcription of the Iſland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serre,</hi> now vulgarly called <hi>Sarre,</hi> is the firſt place of Note which offers it ſelf up to a view: It was anciently a Pariſh, untill peradventure the unhealthineſſe of the Soile; for it now confines upon Mariſhes (where formerly glided that Gullet of Sea-water, now wholly ſtifled with Sand) which made <hi>Thanett</hi> an Iſland, as may plainly appear by an ancient Mapp, printed by the original, and now extant in the Book called <hi>Monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum Anglicanum</hi>) or elſe from the inſalubrity of the Air, which being polluted with thoſe black and foggie vapours which aſcend from a looſe and ſoggie earth, very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently leave a venomous Tincture upon the Blood and Spirits of thoſe Inhabitants, who are ſubject to the impreſſion of ſuch pernicious exhalations, forced thoſe who dwelt in <hi>Serre,</hi> to abandon ſo ſickly a Habitation; and ſo the Pariſh by degrees, began to languiſh away into that Solitude, we ſee it is ſhrunk into at preſent. The Church was dedicated to St. <hi>Giles,</hi> but at preſent lies entombed in ſuch forgotten Ruines, that ſcarce the leaſt Remains are viſible. The Mannor it ſelf was one of the ancient Seats of the noble Family of <hi>Crioll. Bertram de Crioll</hi> augments the Regiſter of thoſe <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Gentlemen, who were with <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt at the Siege of <hi>Acon</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine. Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew de Crioll</hi> another of this Name and Family, was Lieutenant of <hi>Dover-caſtle</hi> under the aboveſaid Prince. <hi>Simon de Crioll</hi> was with <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, at his proſperous Siege of <hi>Carlaverock,</hi> and for his generous Aſſiſtance there, received the Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and from him it came down to Sir <hi>William Crioll,</hi> Father to Sir <hi>John Crioll</hi> who held it in the Beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, as appears <hi>Pat.</hi> 9. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>Par. prim. Memb.</hi> 19. And from him was it tranſmitted to his Son Sir <hi>Thomas Keriell,</hi> Knight of the Garter, a Man of that worth and eminence, in that time he lived in, that I might ſeem ſomething to obſcure his Glory, if I ſhould not repreſent to the Reader, ſome of thoſe honorable Atchievements, which he performed in <hi>France,</hi> the Relation of which I have omitted in my Deſcription of <hi>Stockbury</hi> and <hi>Walmer.</hi> In the ninth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, he being Governour of <hi>Gourney</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> iſſuedout of that place, and haraſſed not only that Province, but fought with the Earl of <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> who was ſent to oppoſe his Eruptions, and after a ſharp Combat gave him a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſcomfiture, killing about ſix hundred, and captivating two hundred Soldiers. In the fifteenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, he ſeiſed upon the Duke of <hi>Burgundie's</hi> Carriages and Cannons leaving <hi>Cretoy</hi> (a Fortreſſe then in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and not long before diſtreſſed by the aboveſaid Duke) furniſhed with victual for ſix hundred men, for the ſpace of a twelvemonth. And laſtly in the twenty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, he was ſent over into <hi>France,</hi> with a ſupply of 1500 men to recruit the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, where he did as much with ſo ſmall a quantity of men, as could be expected from humane Courage, and having reduced ſome pieces of ſtrength, he encountered the Earl of <hi>Clermont</hi> at a place called <hi>Formigney,</hi> where being overlaid with Multitude, after he had given moſt ſignal Teſtimony of his valour, and diſcharged all thoſe duties which might have ſecured and preſerved the Honor of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and the Glory of the day, by which he declared himſelf to be not only a prudent Man, but an expert Commander, he was defeated: But to proceed, after the Family of <hi>Crioll</hi> went out from the poſſeſſion of this place, which was before the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, <hi>John White</hi> Eſquire, became Lord of the Fee, and held it at his Death, which was in the ninth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth: but after his Deceaſe it was not long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in this Name: for in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, I find it the Inheritance of <hi>Bere,</hi> and was fixed in this Family, untill the Beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and then it was paſſed away by Sale to <hi>Ruſh,</hi> anceſtor to Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Ruſh,</hi> who not many years ſince concluding in two Daughters and Coheirs, one of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:103337:200"/>them by matching with Sir <hi>George Wentworth</hi> of <hi>Wentworth Woodhouſe</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> third Brother to Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Stafford,</hi> hath made it his inſtant patrimony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Downebarton</hi> is the next place which occurs, and challenges our Survey. There was a Family Sirnamed <hi>Exeter,</hi> that had large poſſeſſions at or neer this place, and were planted in the Tenure of them many Centuries of years: In the fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, <hi>Margaret</hi> Widow of <hi>John Exeter,</hi> held Lands at <hi>Downebarton</hi> in Right of Dower, as appears by an Inquiſition taken after her death, which commences from that time. But the principal Honor this place anciently recieved, was, that it was a Mannor which fell under the Signory of the Arch-biſhops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by an Inquiſition taken in the twenty firſt of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Rot. Eſc. Num.</hi> 7. Which repreſents to poſterity what Lands and Mannors <hi>Thomas</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> held at that time; nor did it depart from the revenue of this Sea, until the 29. year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; and then being exchanged with the Crown by <hi>Tho. Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> it was granted away to <hi>Henry Criſpe</hi> Eſquire; in which Family it was fixed untill thoſe times which were circumſcribed within the Verge of our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was conveyed to <hi>Paramour,</hi> from which Name not many years ſince, the viciſſitude of purchaſe carried it away, and hath now made it part of the demeaſn of <hi>Daniel Harvey</hi> of <hi>Combe-nevill,</hi> in <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Thames</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quekes</hi> in <hi>Birchington</hi> was the ancient Seat of an ancient Family which bore that Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, and after it had for many deſcents acknowledged it ſelf to have related to that Name, it devolved by paternal deſcent to <hi>John Quekes,</hi> who about the Beginning of <hi>H.</hi> the ſeventh, expired in a Daughter and Heir who was matched to....<hi>Criſpe,</hi> extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the <hi>Criſpes</hi> of <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> who had flouriſhed there many Generations before, (as appears by an old pedigree now in the hands of Sir <hi>Nicholas Criſpe</hi> of <hi>London</hi>) under the Notion of Gentlemen of the beſt Rank; nor did this Family wither by being thus tranſplanted, and inoculated upon a forraign Stem, but rather did gather new Sap and Verdure, which made it ſo exceedingly ſprout forth, that <hi>Henry Criſpe</hi> Eſquire, who was Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> in the thirty eighth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and was afterwards honoured with Knighthood, did ſhoot up to that power, and grew ſo tall in Title, that he was in the dialect of thoſe Times called <hi>Regulus Inſulae,</hi> or the Governour of the Iſle of <hi>Thannet;</hi> and from this worthy perſon, is <hi>Henry Criſpe</hi> Eſquire, Heir to Sir <hi>Henry Criſpe</hi> not long ſince deceaſed, and now proprietary of <hi>Quekes,</hi> originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended.</p>

                  <hi>Weſt-gate</hi> in <hi>Birchington</hi> was wrapped up in that vaſt demeaſn which was entituled to the poſſeſſion of the noble and powerful Family of <hi>Leybourn</hi> of <hi>Leybourn</hi>-caſtle. <hi>Will. de Leybourn</hi> Son of <hi>Roger de Leybourn,</hi> held it at his Death, which was in the third year of <hi>Ed.</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Rot.

And left it to <hi>Roger de Leybourn,</hi> from whom with the reſt of his diffuſed patrimony in this County, it came to his only Daughter and Heir <hi>Juliana de Leybourn,</hi> firſt matched to <hi>Iohn de Haſtings,</hi> Brother or Kinſman to <hi>Laurence de Haſtings</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and then to <hi>William de Clinton</hi> Earl of <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but ſurvived them both, and dying without Iſſue in the forty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, ſhe made God her Heir to this Mannor, and gave it to the Abby of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtins,</hi> and in the patrimony of that Cloiſter did the Title of this Mannor lie locked up, untill the general Diſſolution in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, unlooſened it, and then linked it again by a new Augmentation to the demeaſn of the Crown; and then the aboveſaid Prince, in the thirty fifth year of his reign, granted it to Sir <hi>Tho. Moile,</hi> who not long after paſſed it away to <hi>Bere,</hi> a Family of good account in this Iſland, as being deſcended from <hi>Richard de Bere,</hi> who was one of the <hi>Recognitores magnae Aſſiſae</hi> for <hi>Kent,</hi> in the ſecond year of King <hi>John,</hi> as appears by the Pipe-roll of that time; and from this Name about the latter end of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> did it by purchaſe come over to <hi>Denne</hi> of <hi>Denne-hill</hi> in <hi>Kingſton,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor Mr. <hi>Thomas Denne</hi> of <hi>Denne-hill,</hi> Reader formerly of the Middle-Temple, and Recorder of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> dying lately without Iſſue-male, his four Daughters (<hi>Thomazin</hi> married to Sir <hi>Nicholas Criſpe, Bridget</hi> matched to Sir <hi>Iohn Darrell</hi> of <hi>Calehill, Dorothy</hi> wedded to Mr. <hi>Roger Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> eſpouſed to <hi>Vincent Denne</hi> Eſquire) became his Coheirs, and and this upon the diviſion of his Eſtate, augmented the patrimony of Sir <hi>Nicholas Criſpe.</hi>

                  <hi>Dandelion</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>St. Johns,</hi> was the Seat of a Family in elder times called <hi>Dent de lyon,</hi> as appears by divers ancient Deeds, ſome without dare, ſome as high as <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt: but about the Government of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the Name was mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted down, and made more ſoft and eaſie, and tranſplanted into <hi>Dandelion,</hi> as appears by ſeveral Deeds of one <hi>John Dandelion,</hi> which commence from that Kings reign, and the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and he had Iſſue <hi>John Dandelion,</hi> who about the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, determined in a Daughter and Heir, matched to <hi>Petit</hi> of <hi>Shalmesford</hi> neer <hi>Chartham,</hi> and lies buryed under a fair Marble in <hi>St. Johns,</hi> with a plate of Braſſe (if the Barbarity of theſe times, have not raviſhed it away) affixed to it, deſigning the time of his death, and by a Right fortified and made firme, from this Alliance, does this ancient Seat now acknowledge the Signory of Mr. <hi>Henry Petit.</hi>

                  <hi>Dene</hi> and <hi>Hengrove</hi> are two Mannots circumſcribed likewiſe within the precincts of <hi>St. Johns,</hi> and were involved in the ſpreading Demeaſn of the powerful Family of <hi>Leybourn,</hi> as appears by a ſolemn Inquiſition taken after the deceaſe of <hi>William de Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn,</hi> who dyed poſſeſt of them in the third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond; and from whom they came to his Grandchild, <hi>Juliana</hi> Sole Heir of <hi>Roger de Leybourn,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Iſſue, in the forty third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, either by <hi>John de Haſtings,</hi> or <hi>William de Clinton</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> conſtiuted the Abby of St. <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> her heir to both theſe places (a more certain Inheritor then any looſe Unthrift in the devout eſtimate of thoſe Times) with this Clauſe annexed, that the Brotherhood of that Covent, ſhould pray for the Souls of <hi>John de Haſtings, Laurence de Haſtings</hi> Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke, John de Haſtings</hi> his Son, and laſtly for that of <hi>William de Clinton</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntingdon;</hi> Which grant of hers was confirmed (as appears by <hi>Thorne</hi> the Chronicler of St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> lately printed) by <hi>Edward</hi> the third, in the year 1363, and it is probable that thoſe two Chappels, which the fabulous Tradition of the Iſland is, were erected at the two aboveſaid places, by two Virgins, were built by the beforementioned <hi>Juliana,</hi> for two Chauntry Prieſts, to celebrate Maſſe for the Souls of her two deceaſed Husbands.

                  <hi>Manſton</hi> is another ancient Seat in St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> which was the Inheritance of <hi>Manſton</hi> for many Generations. <hi>Richard de Manſton,</hi> as I find by the Bundles of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain

                  <hi>Stonar</hi> is the laſt place to be taken Notice of in this Iſland, and although it be a Pariſh now without Inhabitants, and a member of the Cinque-ports belonging to <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and hath not enough left of its former Buildings, to direct you to its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Situation; yet was it formerly a Haven-Town, and had a Fair held there yearly five Days together, before the Feaſt of the Tranſlation of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> which was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this place in the year 1104. In the reign of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> about the year 1090, there aroſe a Suit in Law, between the Londoners, and the Abbot of St. <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> (to whom this Mannor was given, with the reſidue of that revenue, which belonged to the Nunnery at <hi>Minſter</hi> by King <hi>Canutus,</hi> upon the tranſlation of the Body of St. <hi>Mildred</hi> to that Cloiſter) as touching the right of the Haven of <hi>Stonar,</hi> wherein by the favourable Aid of the Prince, the Citizens (as <hi>Spot</hi> Chronicler to that Abby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) had the overthrow. But the utter ruine and ſubverſion of the Town, happened in the year 1385, about the ninth of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, at what time the <hi>French</hi> with 18 Sail of Gallies, deſigning to infeſt the Maritine parts of <hi>Kent,</hi> landed and layed this Town of <hi>Stonar</hi> in Aſhes, which ever ſince hath found a Sepulcher in its own Rubbiſh. And accuſes the bad Government of Sir <hi>Simon de Burley,</hi> the then Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, and Conſtable of <hi>Dover</hi>-Caſtle as cheif Author thereof. For when his demands were utterly refuſed and denyed, and not ſuffered to have the ineſtimable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and Riches of St. <hi>Thomas Beckets</hi> ſhrine, and the Jewels of St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Dover</hi>-Caſtle, upon pretence of ſafe-keeping them there, then he grew ſlack and remiſſe in ſecuring the Sea-Coaſt, and Iſle of <hi>Thanett,</hi> ſo that when the Abbot of St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> had raiſed a conſiderable Strength of his Tenants about <hi>Northburn,</hi> and, bending towards the Iſland, endeavoured to have paſſed over at <hi>Sandwich;</hi> Sir <hi>Simon de Burley</hi> would not permit him, ſo that he was conſtrained by a long and redious March all Night, to go about by <hi>Fordwich</hi> and <hi>Sturrey</hi> into the Iſland, and made ſuch vigorous reſiſtance, that the Enemies fled to their Gallies, without doing any farther prejudice to the Iſlanders. Then Sir <hi>Simon</hi> procures the King to ſend out his Mandate under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> requiring all that had Lands, or belonged to <hi>Sandwich,</hi> to be Commorant there, and to find competent Arms, according to the Quality of their Eſtates and Faculties, upon pain of Impriſonment, and Forfeiture of all they had to looſe. And ſends in the Kings Name to the Abbot to remove with his Forces from <hi>Thanet,</hi> to the Guard of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> as a place of more Importance: But the Abbot (ſaith <hi>Thorne</hi> that continued the Chronicle of <hi>Spot</hi>) neither aſtoniſhed with the power of the Enemy, nor ſeduced with the Inticements, or terrified with the Menaces of the Traytor <hi>Burley,</hi> remained in the Iſland to defend his own and his Tenants poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. After this, there is nothing obſervable at this place, untill the Suppreſſion of the Abby of St. <hi>Auſtins,</hi> and the Reſignation of its Revenue, into the hands of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, when this Mannor with the reſt of their demeaſn, having improved the patrimony of the Crown, it was in the fourth and fifth of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> granted to <hi>Nicholas Criſpe</hi> Eſquire, from whom it is now deſcended to Mr. <hi>Nicholas Criſpe</hi> his Succeſſor, the inſtant Lord of the Fee.</p>

               <p>I ſhall wind up this Diſcourſe, with informing the Reader, that the cheifeſt Scenes both of War and Peace, have been laid in or neer this Iſland. <hi>Rutupis</hi> or <hi>Richborough</hi> on the oppoſite Shore, was an eminent Fortreſſe of the Romans, and the firſt preſidiary Station that Antiquity repreſents them to have erected within <hi>Britain.</hi> When <hi>Hengiſt</hi> arrived with his <hi>Saxons,</hi> to ſupport the harraſſed and afflicted <hi>Britons,</hi> againſt the eruptions of the <hi>Picts,</hi> he firſt landed in this Iſland, and when his Forces were broken by <hi>Vortimer</hi> at the Battle of <hi>Alresford,</hi> he made <hi>Thanet</hi> his Retreat and Shelter; When <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk arrived here in <hi>England</hi> with the light of Truth, to diſpel the miſts of Paganiſme and Infidelity, and diſſeminate the Chriſtian Religion amongſt the <hi>Saxons,</hi> he found his firſt Reception in this Iſland. How often the <hi>Danes</hi> made <hi>Thanet</hi> a Winter Station for their Navies, when they made their barbarous Impreſſions on the Maritime Coaſts of this Nation, I think our Chronicles do ſufficiently inform us. And laſtly, when <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Dolphin</hi> was called in by the mutinous <hi>Engliſh</hi> Barons, to aſſert their Quarrel with additional Supplies againſt King <hi>John,</hi> he laid the firſt Scene of that War in this Iſland, which he afterwards ſcattered on the Face of this unhappy Nation.</p>
